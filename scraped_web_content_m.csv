Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6]Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group.Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9]History[edit]Main article:MotorolaThe company's original logo, used from 2011 to 2013On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.2012–2014: Google ownership[edit]On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19]The installation of the 2013–2014 Motorola Mobility logo near the main Google campus, following Google's purchase. The office on the photo has since been closed.On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22]On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23]On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24]In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26]Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25]2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit]On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35]On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36]Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37]Integration with Lenovo[edit]In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39]In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39]In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42]In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45]Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47]Products[edit]Razr[edit]Black RAZR V3Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world.Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52]Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57]Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59]Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63]Early Android smartphones[edit]Droid[edit]In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65]A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to theiPhonewith the slogan ""iDon't,"" ""Droid Does,"" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon.Flurryestimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability.PC Worldconsidered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole.[66][67][68]The Droid was also named ""Gadget of the Year"" for 2009 byTime.[69]OtherDroid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.[70]In 2010, Motorola released theDroid Xalong with other devices such as theCharm,Flipout, andi1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in ""a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.""[71]In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling ""extremely well.""[72]Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR[edit]On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. TheAtrixwas released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM.[73]The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI.[74][not specific enough to verify]On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company releasedMotorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet,[75]and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.[76]In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola Mobility unveiled theDroid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featuredKevlarbacking, the same used inbulletproof vests, and aGorilla Glassfaceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's ""Best Smartphone"" award.[77]The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.Though Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung andApple.[65]Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola Mobility had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high.[17]Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.Motorola Mobility released theDroid RAZR HD(and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with anIntelpowered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.[citation needed]Google era[edit]Moto X (2013-2015)[edit]Main article:Moto XIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Mobility's vice president of product managementLior Ronexplained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, ""Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it’s about quality and not quantity"".[78]1st generation Moto XSpeaking at the D11 conference inPalos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola Mobility CEODennis Woodsideannounced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility nearFort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named ""Moto X"", will be available to the public in October 2013.[79]The Moto X featuredGoogle Nowsoftware, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can “interact with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices”. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an ""awareness"" of what the user is doing at any given moment.[80]On July 3, 2013, Motorola Mobility released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola Mobility's next flagship phone will be ""the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States"".[81]On the same day that the advertisement was published,ABC Newsreported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.[82]In early July 2013,the Wall Street Journalreported that Motorola Mobility would spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device.

These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US customs at FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee hub due to issues related to the import paperwork.[citation needed]TheMoto X Forcewas launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was Motorola Mobility's flagship device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory.

The top layer of the display is designed to be user-replaceable. The screen and case also have a water repellent nanocoating to protect the device from liquids that could damage internal components.TheMoto X4was introduced in August 2017.

Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6]Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group.Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9]History[edit]Main article:MotorolaThe company's original logo, used from 2011 to 2013On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.2012–2014: Google ownership[edit]On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19]The installation of the 2013–2014 Motorola Mobility logo near the main Google campus, following Google's purchase. The office on the photo has since been closed.On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22]On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23]On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24]In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26]Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25]2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit]On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35]On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36]Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37]Integration with Lenovo[edit]In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39]In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39]In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42]In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45]Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47]Products[edit]Razr[edit]Black RAZR V3Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world.Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52]Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57]Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59]Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63]Early Android smartphones[edit]Droid[edit]In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65]A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to theiPhonewith the slogan ""iDon't,"" ""Droid Does,"" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon.Flurryestimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability.PC Worldconsidered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole.[66][67][68]The Droid was also named ""Gadget of the Year"" for 2009 byTime.[69]OtherDroid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.[70]In 2010, Motorola released theDroid Xalong with other devices such as theCharm,Flipout, andi1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in ""a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.""[71]In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling ""extremely well.""[72]Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR[edit]On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. TheAtrixwas released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM.[73]The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI.[74][not specific enough to verify]On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company releasedMotorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet,[75]and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.[76]In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola Mobility unveiled theDroid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featuredKevlarbacking, the same used inbulletproof vests, and aGorilla Glassfaceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's ""Best Smartphone"" award.[77]The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.Though Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung andApple.[65]Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola Mobility had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high.[17]Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.Motorola Mobility released theDroid RAZR HD(and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with anIntelpowered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.[citation needed]Google era[edit]Moto X (2013-2015)[edit]Main article:Moto XIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Mobility's vice president of product managementLior Ronexplained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, ""Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it’s about quality and not quantity"".[78]1st generation Moto XSpeaking at the D11 conference inPalos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola Mobility CEODennis Woodsideannounced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility nearFort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named ""Moto X"", will be available to the public in October 2013.[79]The Moto X featuredGoogle Nowsoftware, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can “interact with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices”. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an ""awareness"" of what the user is doing at any given moment.[80]On July 3, 2013, Motorola Mobility released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola Mobility's next flagship phone will be ""the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States"".[81]On the same day that the advertisement was published,ABC Newsreported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.[82]In early July 2013,the Wall Street Journalreported that Motorola Mobility would spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device. The amount is equivalent to half of Apple's total advertising budget for 2012.[83]On August 1, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst-generation Moto Xsmartphone. It was released on August 23, 2013, in the US and Canada.[84]On September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released thesecond-generation Moto X. This continued the trend of the company letting consumers customize their devices through their Moto Maker website, and added new customization options like additional real wood choices and new leather options. The device also got many increases in specs. With a new 5.2-inch (13 cm)1080psuper AMOLEDpentiledisplay, a faster 2.5 GHzQualcommSnapdragon801 processor, and an improved 13-megapixel rear camera capable of recording4k resolutionvideo with a dualLED flash. The device also came with new software features along with newinfraredproximity sensors.Moto X StyleTheMoto X PlayandMoto X Stylesmartphones were announced in July 2015, and were released in September 2015.[37]Many customers who have ordered customized Moto X Pure Editions via Motorola Mobility's website have experienced delays receiving their devices.  These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US customs at FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee hub due to issues related to the import paperwork.[citation needed]TheMoto X Forcewas launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was Motorola Mobility's flagship device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory. Like other Moto X devices, it was customizable through Moto Maker. This was Motorola Mobility's first smartphone that featured the company's ""ShatterShield"" technology, which consists of two touchscreen elements, reinforced by an internal aluminum frame to make it resistant to bending and cracking, although this does not protect against scratches or other superficial screen damage. The top layer of the display is designed to be user-replaceable. The screen and case also have a water repellent nanocoating to protect the device from liquids that could damage internal components.TheMoto X4was introduced in August 2017. It featured a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display compared to Moto X 2014, and 3, 4, or 6 GB of RAM depending on versions. There were three iterations: a retail one from Motorola Mobility, anAndroid Oneversion from Google, and anAmazon Primeedition. Unllike its predecessors, the Moto X4 did not offer some older Moto X exclusive features such as the Moto Maker. The phone came withAndroid Nougat7.1.1 and Moto features, with support of 'A/B Partitions' and 'seamless update'. It was updated toAndroid Oreo[85]in late 2017 andAndroid Pie[86]in 2018. It was succeeded by the Motorola One lineup since 2018.Droid Mini, Ultra and Maxx[edit]Main articles:Droid Mini,Droid Ultra, andDroid MaxxDroid Mini, Droid Ultra and Droid Maxx were announced in a Verizon press conference on July 23, 2013. These phones share similar design with the predecessing Droid Razr HD lines in different screen and battery sizes, while all featuring the sameMotorola X8 Mobile Computing Systemas the first-generation Moto X, with exclusive features like Motorola Active Notifications and 'OK Google' on device neural-based voice recognition system.In September 2015, Droid Maxx 2 were launched as Verizon exclusives in the US market, which share the same overall design as theMoto X Style, with Verizon software on board. Unlike its Moto X counterpart, Droid Maxx 2 did not support Moto Maker for customization.Moto G[edit]Main article:Moto GOn November 13, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst generation Moto G, a relatively low-cost smartphone. The Moto G had been launched in several markets, including the UK, United States, France, Germany, India and parts of Latin America and Asia.

(2011–2014)[1]Company typeSubsidiaryTraded asNYSE: MMIISINUS6200971058IndustryConsumer electronicsPredecessorMotorola, Inc.FoundedJanuary 4, 2011; 13 years ago(2011-01-04)HeadquartersMerchandise MartChicago, Illinois,United StatesArea servedWorldwideKey peopleSergio Buniac (President)[2]ProductsSmartphonesSmartwatchesSmartphone accessoriesTelevisionsNumber of employees1,001–5,000[3]ParentGoogle(2012–2014)Lenovo(2014–present)SubsidiariesMotorola Trademark Holdings, LLCWebsitewww.motorola.comMotorola Mobility LLC, marketed asMotorola, is an Americanconsumer electronicsmanufacturer primarily producingsmartphonesand other mobile devices runningAndroid. Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6]Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group.Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9]History[edit]Main article:MotorolaThe company's original logo, used from 2011 to 2013On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.2012–2014: Google ownership[edit]On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19]The installation of the 2013–2014 Motorola Mobility logo near the main Google campus, following Google's purchase. The office on the photo has since been closed.On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22]On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23]On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24]In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26]Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25]2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit]On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35]On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36]Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37]Integration with Lenovo[edit]In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39]In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39]In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42]In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45]Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47]Products[edit]Razr[edit]Black RAZR V3Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world.Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52]Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57]Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59]Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63]Early Android smartphones[edit]Droid[edit]In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65]A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to theiPhonewith the slogan ""iDon't,"" ""Droid Does,"" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon.Flurryestimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability.PC Worldconsidered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole.[66][67][68]The Droid was also named ""Gadget of the Year"" for 2009 byTime.[69]OtherDroid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.[70]In 2010, Motorola released theDroid Xalong with other devices such as theCharm,Flipout, andi1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in ""a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.""[71]In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling ""extremely well.""[72]Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR[edit]On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. TheAtrixwas released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM.[73]The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI.[74][not specific enough to verify]On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company releasedMotorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet,[75]and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.[76]In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola Mobility unveiled theDroid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featuredKevlarbacking, the same used inbulletproof vests, and aGorilla Glassfaceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's ""Best Smartphone"" award.[77]The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.Though Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung andApple.[65]Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola Mobility had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high.[17]Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.Motorola Mobility released theDroid RAZR HD(and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with anIntelpowered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.[citation needed]Google era[edit]Moto X (2013-2015)[edit]Main article:Moto XIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Mobility's vice president of product managementLior Ronexplained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, ""Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it’s about quality and not quantity"".[78]1st generation Moto XSpeaking at the D11 conference inPalos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola Mobility CEODennis Woodsideannounced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility nearFort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named ""Moto X"", will be available to the public in October 2013.[79]The Moto X featuredGoogle Nowsoftware, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can “interact with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices”. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an ""awareness"" of what the user is doing at any given moment.[80]On July 3, 2013, Motorola Mobility released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola Mobility's next flagship phone will be ""the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States"".[81]On the same day that the advertisement was published,ABC Newsreported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.[82]In early July 2013,the Wall Street Journalreported that Motorola Mobility would spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device. The amount is equivalent to half of Apple's total advertising budget for 2012.[83]On August 1, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst-generation Moto Xsmartphone. It was released on August 23, 2013, in the US and Canada.[84]On September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released thesecond-generation Moto X. This continued the trend of the company letting consumers customize their devices through their Moto Maker website, and added new customization options like additional real wood choices and new leather options. The device also got many increases in specs. With a new 5.2-inch (13 cm)1080psuper AMOLEDpentiledisplay, a faster 2.5 GHzQualcommSnapdragon801 processor, and an improved 13-megapixel rear camera capable of recording4k resolutionvideo with a dualLED flash. The device also came with new software features along with newinfraredproximity sensors.Moto X StyleTheMoto X PlayandMoto X Stylesmartphones were announced in July 2015, and were released in September 2015.[37]Many customers who have ordered customized Moto X Pure Editions via Motorola Mobility's website have experienced delays receiving their devices.  These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US customs at FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee hub due to issues related to the import paperwork.[citation needed]TheMoto X Forcewas launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was Motorola Mobility's flagship device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory. Like other Moto X devices, it was customizable through Moto Maker. This was Motorola Mobility's first smartphone that featured the company's ""ShatterShield"" technology, which consists of two touchscreen elements, reinforced by an internal aluminum frame to make it resistant to bending and cracking, although this does not protect against scratches or other superficial screen damage. The top layer of the display is designed to be user-replaceable. The screen and case also have a water repellent nanocoating to protect the device from liquids that could damage internal components.TheMoto X4was introduced in August 2017. It featured a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display compared to Moto X 2014, and 3, 4, or 6 GB of RAM depending on versions. There were three iterations: a retail one from Motorola Mobility, anAndroid Oneversion from Google, and anAmazon Primeedition. Unllike its predecessors, the Moto X4 did not offer some older Moto X exclusive features such as the Moto Maker. The phone came withAndroid Nougat7.1.1 and Moto features, with support of 'A/B Partitions' and 'seamless update'. It was updated toAndroid Oreo[85]in late 2017 andAndroid Pie[86]in 2018. It was succeeded by the Motorola One lineup since 2018.Droid Mini, Ultra and Maxx[edit]Main articles:Droid Mini,Droid Ultra, andDroid MaxxDroid Mini, Droid Ultra and Droid Maxx were announced in a Verizon press conference on July 23, 2013. These phones share similar design with the predecessing Droid Razr HD lines in different screen and battery sizes, while all featuring the sameMotorola X8 Mobile Computing Systemas the first-generation Moto X, with exclusive features like Motorola Active Notifications and 'OK Google' on device neural-based voice recognition system.In September 2015, Droid Maxx 2 were launched as Verizon exclusives in the US market, which share the same overall design as theMoto X Style, with Verizon software on board.

Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6]Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group.Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9]History[edit]Main article:MotorolaThe company's original logo, used from 2011 to 2013On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.2012–2014: Google ownership[edit]On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19]The installation of the 2013–2014 Motorola Mobility logo near the main Google campus, following Google's purchase. The office on the photo has since been closed.On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22]On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23]On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24]In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26]Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25]2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit]On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35]On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36]Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37]Integration with Lenovo[edit]In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39]In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39]In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42]In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45]Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47]Products[edit]Razr[edit]Black RAZR V3Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world.Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52]Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57]Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59]Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63]Early Android smartphones[edit]Droid[edit]In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65]A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to theiPhonewith the slogan ""iDon't,"" ""Droid Does,"" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon.Flurryestimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability.PC Worldconsidered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole.[66][67][68]The Droid was also named ""Gadget of the Year"" for 2009 byTime.[69]OtherDroid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.[70]In 2010, Motorola released theDroid Xalong with other devices such as theCharm,Flipout, andi1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in ""a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.""[71]In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling ""extremely well.""[72]Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR[edit]On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. TheAtrixwas released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM.[73]The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI.[74][not specific enough to verify]On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company releasedMotorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet,[75]and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.[76]In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola Mobility unveiled theDroid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featuredKevlarbacking, the same used inbulletproof vests, and aGorilla Glassfaceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's ""Best Smartphone"" award.[77]The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.Though Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung andApple.[65]Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola Mobility had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high.[17]Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.Motorola Mobility released theDroid RAZR HD(and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with anIntelpowered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.[citation needed]Google era[edit]Moto X (2013-2015)[edit]Main article:Moto XIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Mobility's vice president of product managementLior Ronexplained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, ""Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it’s about quality and not quantity"".[78]1st generation Moto XSpeaking at the D11 conference inPalos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola Mobility CEODennis Woodsideannounced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility nearFort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named ""Moto X"", will be available to the public in October 2013.[79]The Moto X featuredGoogle Nowsoftware, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can “interact with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices”. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an ""awareness"" of what the user is doing at any given moment.[80]On July 3, 2013, Motorola Mobility released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola Mobility's next flagship phone will be ""the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States"".[81]On the same day that the advertisement was published,ABC Newsreported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.[82]In early July 2013,the Wall Street Journalreported that Motorola Mobility would spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device. The amount is equivalent to half of Apple's total advertising budget for 2012.[83]On August 1, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst-generation Moto Xsmartphone. It was released on August 23, 2013, in the US and Canada.[84]On September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released thesecond-generation Moto X.

Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6]Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group.Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9]History[edit]Main article:MotorolaThe company's original logo, used from 2011 to 2013On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.2012–2014: Google ownership[edit]On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19]The installation of the 2013–2014 Motorola Mobility logo near the main Google campus, following Google's purchase. The office on the photo has since been closed.On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22]On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23]On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24]In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26]Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25]2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit]On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35]On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36]Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37]Integration with Lenovo[edit]In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39]In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39]In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42]In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45]Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47]Products[edit]Razr[edit]Black RAZR V3Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world.Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52]Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57]Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59]Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63]Early Android smartphones[edit]Droid[edit]In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65]A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to theiPhonewith the slogan ""iDon't,"" ""Droid Does,"" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon.Flurryestimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability.PC Worldconsidered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole.[66][67][68]The Droid was also named ""Gadget of the Year"" for 2009 byTime.[69]OtherDroid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.[70]In 2010, Motorola released theDroid Xalong with other devices such as theCharm,Flipout, andi1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in ""a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.""[71]In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling ""extremely well.""[72]Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR[edit]On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. TheAtrixwas released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM.[73]The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI.[74][not specific enough to verify]On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company releasedMotorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet,[75]and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.[76]In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola Mobility unveiled theDroid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featuredKevlarbacking, the same used inbulletproof vests, and aGorilla Glassfaceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's ""Best Smartphone"" award.[77]The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.Though Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung andApple.[65]Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola Mobility had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high.[17]Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.Motorola Mobility released theDroid RAZR HD(and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with anIntelpowered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.[citation needed]Google era[edit]Moto X (2013-2015)[edit]Main article:Moto XIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Mobility's vice president of product managementLior Ronexplained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, ""Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it’s about quality and not quantity"".[78]1st generation Moto XSpeaking at the D11 conference inPalos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola Mobility CEODennis Woodsideannounced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility nearFort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named ""Moto X"", will be available to the public in October 2013.[79]The Moto X featuredGoogle Nowsoftware, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can “interact with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices”. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an ""awareness"" of what the user is doing at any given moment.[80]On July 3, 2013, Motorola Mobility released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola Mobility's next flagship phone will be ""the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States"".[81]On the same day that the advertisement was published,ABC Newsreported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.[82]In early July 2013,the Wall Street Journalreported that Motorola Mobility would spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device. The amount is equivalent to half of Apple's total advertising budget for 2012.[83]On August 1, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst-generation Moto Xsmartphone. It was released on August 23, 2013, in the US and Canada.[84]On September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released thesecond-generation Moto X. This continued the trend of the company letting consumers customize their devices through their Moto Maker website, and added new customization options like additional real wood choices and new leather options. The device also got many increases in specs. With a new 5.2-inch (13 cm)1080psuper AMOLEDpentiledisplay, a faster 2.5 GHzQualcommSnapdragon801 processor, and an improved 13-megapixel rear camera capable of recording4k resolutionvideo with a dualLED flash. The device also came with new software features along with newinfraredproximity sensors.Moto X StyleTheMoto X PlayandMoto X Stylesmartphones were announced in July 2015, and were released in September 2015.[37]Many customers who have ordered customized Moto X Pure Editions via Motorola Mobility's website have experienced delays receiving their devices.  These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US customs at FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee hub due to issues related to the import paperwork.[citation needed]TheMoto X Forcewas launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was Motorola Mobility's flagship device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory. Like other Moto X devices, it was customizable through Moto Maker. This was Motorola Mobility's first smartphone that featured the company's ""ShatterShield"" technology, which consists of two touchscreen elements, reinforced by an internal aluminum frame to make it resistant to bending and cracking, although this does not protect against scratches or other superficial screen damage. The top layer of the display is designed to be user-replaceable. The screen and case also have a water repellent nanocoating to protect the device from liquids that could damage internal components.TheMoto X4was introduced in August 2017. It featured a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display compared to Moto X 2014, and 3, 4, or 6 GB of RAM depending on versions.

Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6]Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines.In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group.Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9]History[edit]Main article:MotorolaThe company's original logo, used from 2011 to 2013On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company.2012–2014: Google ownership[edit]On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19]The installation of the 2013–2014 Motorola Mobility logo near the main Google campus, following Google's purchase. The office on the photo has since been closed.On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22]On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23]On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24]In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26]Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25]2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit]On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35]On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36]Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37]Integration with Lenovo[edit]In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39]In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39]In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42]In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45]Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47]Products[edit]Razr[edit]Black RAZR V3Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world.Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006.The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52]Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57]Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59]Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63]Early Android smartphones[edit]Droid[edit]In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65]A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009. Backed with a marketing campaign by Verizon, which promoted the device as a direct competitor to theiPhonewith the slogan ""iDon't,"" ""Droid Does,"" the Droid was a significant success for Motorola and Verizon.Flurryestimated that at least 250,000 Droid smartphones had been sold in its first week of availability.PC Worldconsidered the sales figures to be an indicator of mainstream growth for the Android platform as a whole.[66][67][68]The Droid was also named ""Gadget of the Year"" for 2009 byTime.[69]OtherDroid-branded devices would be released by Verizon, although not all of them were manufactured by Motorola.[70]In 2010, Motorola released theDroid Xalong with other devices such as theCharm,Flipout, andi1. In July 2010, Motorola reported that it had sold 2.7 million smartphones during the second quarter of 2010, an increase of 400,000 units over the first quarter. Jha stated that the company was in ""a strong position to continue improving our share in the rapidly growing smartphone market and improve our operating performance.""[71]In its third quarter earnings report, Jha reaffirmed that the Droid X was selling ""extremely well.""[72]Atrix 4G, Droid Bionic, XOOM, and Droid RAZR[edit]On January 5, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that the Atrix 4G and the Droid Bionic were headed to AT&T and Verizon, respectively, with expected release dates in Q1 of 2011. TheAtrixwas released on February 22 as the world's first phone with both a Dual-Core Processor and 1 GB of RAM.[73]The phone also had optional peripherals such as a Multimedia Dock and a Laptop Dock which launched a Webtop UI.[74][not specific enough to verify]On February 24, two days after the release of Atrix, the company releasedMotorola Xoom, the world's first Android 3.0 tablet,[75]and followed it up shortly afterwards with an update to make it the world's first Android 3.1 tablet.[76]In the fourth quarter of 2011, Motorola Mobility unveiled theDroid RAZR, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone at that time at just 7.1 mm. The Droid Razr featuredKevlarbacking, the same used inbulletproof vests, and aGorilla Glassfaceplate. The phone was very successful through Verizon Wireless, and many color variants were released. In addition, a Maxx version of the Droid RAZR with an extended battery was released at CES 2012. The Droid RAZR MAXX won CTIA's ""Best Smartphone"" award.[77]The company also announced new products by late 2011 and early 2012 such as the Xoom 2 tablets, the motoACTV fitness watch with Android, and the Droid 4 with 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless.Though Jha managed to restore some of the lost luster to Motorola Mobility, it struggled against Samsung andApple.[65]Even among Android manufacturers, Motorola Mobility had dropped behind Samsung, HTC, and LG in market share by the second quarter of 2011. This may have been due to the delay in releasing 4G LTE-capable devices, as well as setting the prices of its new products too high.[17]Jha was replaced by Dennis Woodside as CEO by May 2012, when the Google acquisition was complete.Motorola Mobility released theDroid RAZR HD(and Droid RAZR MAXX HD) as its 2012 flagship devices, featuring improvements over 2011's RAZR. A lower end RAZR M was released, along with anIntelpowered RAZR i. Through late 2012 until 2013's third quarter, no further devices were released, except for the lower end RAZR D1 and D3 devices for Latin America.[citation needed]Google era[edit]Moto X (2013-2015)[edit]Main article:Moto XIn an August 2013 interview, Motorola Mobility's vice president of product managementLior Ronexplained that the company will focus on the production of fewer products to focus on quality rather than quantity. Ron stated, ""Our mandate from Google, from Larry, is really to innovate and take long-term bets. When you have that sort of mentality, it’s about quality and not quantity"".[78]1st generation Moto XSpeaking at the D11 conference inPalos Verdes, California, in May 2013, Motorola Mobility CEODennis Woodsideannounced that a new mobile device would be built by his company at a 500,000 square-feet facility nearFort Worth, Texas, formerly used by Nokia. The facility will employ 2,000 people by August 2013 and the new phone, to be named ""Moto X"", will be available to the public in October 2013.[79]The Moto X featuredGoogle Nowsoftware, and an array of sensors and two microprocessors that will mean that users can “interact with [the phone] in very different ways than you can with other devices”. Media reports suggested that the phone will be able to activate functions preemptively based on an ""awareness"" of what the user is doing at any given moment.[80]On July 3, 2013, Motorola Mobility released a full-page color advertisement in many prominent newspapers across the US. It claimed that Motorola Mobility's next flagship phone will be ""the first smartphone designed, engineered, and assembled in the United States"".[81]On the same day that the advertisement was published,ABC Newsreported that customers will be able to choose the color of the phone, as well as add custom engravings and wallpaper at the time of purchase.[82]In early July 2013,the Wall Street Journalreported that Motorola Mobility would spend nearly US$500 million on global advertising and marketing for the device. The amount is equivalent to half of Apple's total advertising budget for 2012.[83]On August 1, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst-generation Moto Xsmartphone. It was released on August 23, 2013, in the US and Canada.[84]On September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released thesecond-generation Moto X. This continued the trend of the company letting consumers customize their devices through their Moto Maker website, and added new customization options like additional real wood choices and new leather options. The device also got many increases in specs. With a new 5.2-inch (13 cm)1080psuper AMOLEDpentiledisplay, a faster 2.5 GHzQualcommSnapdragon801 processor, and an improved 13-megapixel rear camera capable of recording4k resolutionvideo with a dualLED flash. The device also came with new software features along with newinfraredproximity sensors.Moto X StyleTheMoto X PlayandMoto X Stylesmartphones were announced in July 2015, and were released in September 2015.[37]Many customers who have ordered customized Moto X Pure Editions via Motorola Mobility's website have experienced delays receiving their devices.  These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US customs at FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee hub due to issues related to the import paperwork.[citation needed]TheMoto X Forcewas launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was Motorola Mobility's flagship device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory. Like other Moto X devices, it was customizable through Moto Maker. This was Motorola Mobility's first smartphone that featured the company's ""ShatterShield"" technology, which consists of two touchscreen elements, reinforced by an internal aluminum frame to make it resistant to bending and cracking, although this does not protect against scratches or other superficial screen damage. The top layer of the display is designed to be user-replaceable. The screen and case also have a water repellent nanocoating to protect the device from liquids that could damage internal components.TheMoto X4was introduced in August 2017. It featured a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display compared to Moto X 2014, and 3, 4, or 6 GB of RAM depending on versions. There were three iterations: a retail one from Motorola Mobility, anAndroid Oneversion from Google, and anAmazon Primeedition. Unllike its predecessors, the Moto X4 did not offer some older Moto X exclusive features such as the Moto Maker. The phone came withAndroid Nougat7.1.1 and Moto features, with support of 'A/B Partitions' and 'seamless update'. It was updated toAndroid Oreo[85]in late 2017 andAndroid Pie[86]in 2018. It was succeeded by the Motorola One lineup since 2018.Droid Mini, Ultra and Maxx[edit]Main articles:Droid Mini,Droid Ultra, andDroid MaxxDroid Mini, Droid Ultra and Droid Maxx were announced in a Verizon press conference on July 23, 2013. These phones share similar design with the predecessing Droid Razr HD lines in different screen and battery sizes, while all featuring the sameMotorola X8 Mobile Computing Systemas the first-generation Moto X, with exclusive features like Motorola Active Notifications and 'OK Google' on device neural-based voice recognition system.In September 2015, Droid Maxx 2 were launched as Verizon exclusives in the US market, which share the same overall design as theMoto X Style, with Verizon software on board. Unlike its Moto X counterpart, Droid Maxx 2 did not support Moto Maker for customization.Moto G[edit]Main article:Moto GOn November 13, 2013, Motorola Mobility unveiled thefirst generation Moto G, a relatively low-cost smartphone. The Moto G had been launched in several markets, including the UK, United States, France, Germany, India and parts of Latin America and Asia. The Moto G was available in the United States, unlocked, for a starting price of US$179. The device is geared toward global markets and some US models support4G LTE. Unlike the Moto X, the Moto G was not manufactured in the United States.[87]2nd generation Moto GOn September 5, 2014, Motorola Mobility released its successor to the 2013 version of the Moto G, called theMoto G (2nd generation).

It came in two versions, a 3G-only one powered by a Snapdragon 200 chipset and a 4G LTE version powered by a Snapdragon 410 chipset. As before, it shipped with a stock version ofAndroid5.0 ""Lollipop"".In 2015 Motorola Mobility marketed the 2nd generation Moto E with the promise of continual updates and support, ""And while other smartphones in this category don't always support upgrades, we won't forget about you, and we'll make sure your Moto E stays up to date after you buy it."" However, 219 days after launch Motorola announced that the device would not receive an upgrade from Lollipop to6.0 ""Marshmallow"".[93]It was later announced that the LTE variant of the device would receive an upgrade to Marshmallow in Canada, Europe, Latin America, and Asia (excluding China).

It was the first 6-inch smartphone in the mainstream market, and came with many high-end specs. It was the successor to the Nexus 5, Google's previous flagship phone from theirGoogle Nexusseries of devices. Its design was similar to theMoto X (2nd generation)but with a larger display and dual, front-facing speakers rather than the single front-facing speaker on the Moto X. It was the first phone running vanillaAndroid Lollipop, receiving software updates directly fromGoogle.

Headquartered atMerchandise MartinChicago,Illinois, it is a subsidiary of the Chinese technology companyLenovo.[4][5][6] [ ] [ ] [ ] Motorola Mobility was formed on January 4, 2011, after a split ofMotorola, Inc.into two separate companies, with Motorola Mobility assuming the company's consumer-oriented product lines (including itsmobile phonebusiness, as well as itscable modemsandpay televisionset-top boxes), whileMotorola Solutionsassumed the company's enterprise-oriented product lines. In May 2012 Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion; the main intent of the purchase was to gain Motorola Mobility'spatentportfolio, in order to protect other Android vendors from litigation.[7]Under Google, Motorola Mobility increased its focus on the entry-level smartphone market, and under theGoogle ATAPdivision, began development onProject Ara—a platform for modular smartphones with interchangeable components. Shortly after the purchase, Google sold Motorola Mobility's cable modem and set-top box business toArris Group. [ ] Google's ownership of the company was short-lived. In January 2014, Google announced that it would sell Motorola Mobility to Lenovo for $2.91 billion. The sale, which excluded ATAP and all but 2,000 of Motorola Mobility's patents, was completed on 30 October 2014.[8]Lenovo disclosed an intent to use Motorola Mobility as a way to expand into the United States smartphone market. In August 2015, Lenovo'sexisting smartphone divisionwas subsumed by Motorola Mobility.[9] [ ] [ ] History[edit] History [edit] [ edit ] Main article:Motorola On January 4, 2011,Motorola, Inc.was split into two publicly traded companies;Motorola Solutionstook on the company's enterprise-oriented business units, while the remaining consumer division was taken on by Motorola Mobility.[10]Motorola Mobility originally consisted of the mobile devices business, which producedsmartphones, mobile accessories including Bluetooth headphones, and the home business, which producedset-top boxes, end-to-end video solutions, cordless phones, andcable modems.[10]Legally, the split was structured so that Motorola Inc. changed its name to Motorola Solutions and spun off Motorola Mobility as a new publicly traded company. [ ] [ ] 2012–2014: Google ownership[edit] 2012–2014: Google ownership  [edit] [ edit ] On August 15, 2011, American technology companyGoogleannounced that it would acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, pending regulatory approval.[11][12][13]Critics viewed Google as being awhite knight, since Motorola Mobility had recently had a fifth straight quarter of losses.[14]Google planned to operate Motorola Mobility as an independent company.[15]In a post on the company's blog, Google CEO and co-founderLarry Pagerevealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility was a strategic move to strengthen Google'spatentportfolio. At the time, the company had 17,000 patents, with 7,500 patents pending.[16][17]The expanded portfolio was to defend the viability of itsAndroidoperating system, which had been the subject of numerouspatent infringementlawsuits between device vendors and other companies such asApple,MicrosoftandOracle.[16][18][19] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] On November 17, 2011, Motorola Mobility announced that its shareholders voted in favor of the company's acquisition by Google for $12.5 billion. The deal received regulatory approval from theUnited States Department of Justiceand theEuropean Unionon February 13, 2012.[20]The deal received subsequent approval from Chinese authorities and was completed on May 22, 2012.[21]Alongside the completion of the acquisition, Motorola Mobility's CEOSanjay Jhawas replaced byDennis Woodside, a former senior vice president at Google.[22] [ ] [ ] [ ] On August 13, 2012, Google announced that it would cut 4,000 employees and close one third of the company's locations, mostly outside the US.[23] [ ] On December 19, 2012, it was announced thatArris Groupwould purchase Motorola Mobility'scable modemandset-top boxbusiness for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction.[24] [ ] In May 2013, Motorola Mobility opened a factory inFort Worth,Texas, with the intent to assemble customized smartphones in the US. At its peak, the factory employed 3,800 workers.[25]On April 9, 2014, following the departure of Woodside, lead product developerRick Osterlohwas named the new president of Motorola Mobility.[26] [ ] [ ] Under Google ownership, Motorola Mobility's market share would be boosted by a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones, aimed primarily atemerging markets; in the first quarter of 2014, Motorola Mobility sold 6.5 million phones—led by strong sales of its low-endMoto G, especially in markets such as India, and in the United Kingdom—where the company accounted for 6% of smartphone sales sold in the quarter, up from nearly zero. These goals were compounded further by the May 2014 introduction of theMoto E—a low-end device aimed at first-time smartphone owners in emerging markets.[27][28][29][30]In May 2014, Motorola Mobility announced that it would close its Fort Worth factory by the end of the year, citing the high costs of domestic manufacturing in combination with the weak sales of theMoto X(which was customized and assembled at the plant) and the company's increased emphasis on low-end devices and emerging markets.[25] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 2014–present: Lenovo ownership[edit] 2014–present: Lenovo ownership  [edit] [ edit ] On January 29, 2014, Google announced it would, pending regulatory approval, sell Motorola Mobility to the Chinese technology companyLenovofor US$2.91 billion in a cash-and-stock deal,[4]seeing the sale of $750 million in Lenovo shares to Google. Google retained the Advanced Technologies & Projects unit (which was integrated into the main Android team), and all but 2000 of the company's patents. Lenovo had prominently disclosed its intent to enter the U.S. smartphone market, and had previously expressed interest in acquiringBlackBerry, but was reportedly blocked by the Canadian government due to national security concerns.[31][32][33][34]The acquisition was completed on October 30, 2014. The company remained headquartered inChicago, and continued to use the Motorola brand, while Liu Jun (刘军) — president of Lenovo's mobile device business, became the company's chairman.[35] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 刘军 刘军 [ ] On January 26, 2015, owing to its new ownership, Motorola Mobility re-launched its product line in China with the local release of thesecond-generation Moto X, and an upcoming release of theMoto G LTEand Moto X Pro (a re-brandedNexus 6) in time for theChinese New Year.[36] [ ] Lenovo maintained a ""hands-off"" approach in regards to Motorola Mobility's product development. Head designer Jim Wicks explained that ""Google had very little influence and Lenovo has been the same."" The company continued to engage in practices it adopted under Google, such as the use of nearly ""stock"" Android, undercutting competitor's pricing while offering superior hardware (as further encouraged by Lenovo), and placing a larger focus on direct-to-consumer selling of unlocked phones in the US market (as opposed to carrier subsidized versions).[37]On July 28, 2015, Motorola Mobility unveiled three new devices, and its first under Lenovo ownership—thethird-generation Moto G,Moto X Play, andMoto X Style—in three separate events.[37] [ ] [ ] Integration with Lenovo[edit] Integration with Lenovo [edit] [ edit ] In August 2015, Lenovo announced that it would merge its existing smartphone division, including design, development, and manufacturing, into the Motorola Mobility unit. The announcement came in addition to a cut of 3,200 jobs across the entire company.[38]As a result of the change, Motorola Mobility will be responsible for the development and production of its own ""Moto"" product line, as well as Lenovo's own ""Vibe"" range.[39] [ ] [ ] In January 2016, Lenovo announced that the ""Motorola"" name would be further downplayed in public usage in favor of the ""Moto"" brand. Motorola Mobility later clarified that the ""Motorola"" brand will continue to be used in product packaging and through its brand licensees. The company said that ""the Motorola legacy is near and dear to us as product designers, engineers and Motorola [Mobility] employees, and clearly it's important to many of you who have had long relationships with us. We plan to continue it under our parent company, Lenovo.""[39] [ ] In response to claims by a Lenovo executive that only high-end devices would be produced under the ""Moto"" name, with low-end devices being amalgamated into Lenovo's existing ""Vibe"" brand, Motorola Mobility clarified its plans and explained that it would continue to release low-end products under the Moto brand, including the popular Moto G and Moto E lines. Motorola Mobility stated that there would be overlap between the Vibe and Moto lines in some price points and territories, but that both brands would have different ""identities"" and experiences. Moto devices would be positioned as ""innovative"" and ""trendsetting"" products, and Vibe would be a ""mass-market challenger brand"".[40][41][42] [ ] [ ] [ ] In November 2016, it was reported that Lenovo would be branding all its future smartphones under the brand ""Moto by Lenovo"".[43][44]In March 2017, it was reported that Lenovo would continue to use the ""Motorola"" brand and logo, citing itsrecognitionas a heritage cellphone brand. Furthermore, Aymar de Lencquesaing, Motorola Mobility's president at the time, stated that Lenovo planned to phase out its self-branded smartphones in favor of the Motorola brand.[45] [ ] [ ] [ ] Under Lenovo, Motorola Mobility has faced criticism for having an increasingly poor commitment to maintaining Android software updates for its devices, exemplified by negative responses to a 2019 announcement thatAndroid 9.0 ""Pie""updates to the Moto Z2 Force in the United States would only be available to theVerizon Wirelessmodel.[46][47] [ ] [ ] Products[edit] Products [edit] [ edit ] Razr[edit] Razr [edit] [ edit ] Motorola Mobility's predecessor Motorola, Inc. released theRazr V3in the third quarter of 2004.[48]Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,[49]but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.[50]Over the Razr four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the bestsellingclamshellphone in the world. [ ] [ ] [ ] Motorola released other phones based on the Razr design as part of the4LTRline. These include thePebl U6,Slvr L6,Slvr L7(more expensive variant of Slvr L6),Razr V3c(CDMA),Razr V3i(with upgraded camera and appearance and iTunes syncing for 100 songs), V3x (supports3Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera),Razr V3xx(supports3.5Gtechnology) andRazr maxx V6(supports3.5Gtechnology and has a 2-megapixel camera) announced in July 2006. The Razr series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeedingMotorola Razr2series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the Razr, the Razr2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch-sensitive external screen. The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.[51]However, Razr2 sales were only half of the original in the same period.[52] [ ] [ ] Because Motorola relied so long upon the Razr and its derivatives[53][54]and was slow to develop new products in the growing market for feature-rich touchscreen and 3G phones,[55]the Razr appeal declined while rival offerings like theLG Chocolate,BlackBerry, andiPhonecaptured, leading Motorola to eventually drop behindSamsungandLGin market share for mobile phones.[56]Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.[54][57] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Motorola capitalized on the Razr too long and it was also slow adopting 3G. WhileNokiamanaged to retain its lead of the worldwide cellular market, Motorola was surpassed first bySamsungand thenLG Electronics.[58][59]By 2007, without new cellphones that carriers wanted to offer, Motorola sold tens of millions of Razrs and their offshoots by slashing prices, causing margins to collapse in the process.[60]CEO of MotorolaEd Zanderdeparted forDell, while his successor failed to turn around the struggling mobile handset division.[59] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] Motorola continued to experience severe problems with its cellphone/handset division in the latter-2000s, recording a record $1.2 billion loss in Q4 2007.[61]Its global competitiveness continued to decline: from 18.4% market share in 2007, to 9.7% by 2008. By 2010 Motorola's global market share had dropped to seventh place, leading to speculation of bankruptcy of the company.[62]While Motorola's other businesses were thriving, the poor results from the Mobile Devices Unit as well as the 2008 financial crisis delayed the company plans to spinoff the mobile division.[63] [ ] [ ] [ ] Early Android smartphones[edit] Early Android smartphones [edit] [ edit ] Droid[edit] Droid [edit] [ edit ] In 2008,Sanjay Jhatook over as co-chief executive officer of Motorola's mobile device division; under Jha's control, significant changes were made to Motorola's mobile phone business, including most prominently, a shift to the recently introducedAndroidoperating system as its solesmartphoneplatform, replacing bothSymbianandWindows Mobile. In August 2009, Motorola introduced theCliq, its first Android device, forT-Mobile USA. The device also featured a user interface known asMotoblur, which aimed to aggregate information from various sources, such as e-mail andsocial networking services, into a consistent interface.[64][65] [ ] [ ] A month later, Motorola unveiledthe Droid,Verizon Wireless's first Android phone, which was released on November 8, 2009.

TheMoto X PlayandMoto X Stylesmartphones were announced in July 2015, and were released in September 2015.[37]Many customers who have ordered customized Moto X Pure Editions via Motorola Mobility's website have experienced delays receiving their devices.  These delays have been attributed to issues including manufacturing issues, lack of parts needed to complete assembly of custom phones (black fronts, Verizon SIM cards and 64 GB versions), a possible redesign due to initial phones having a defect that causes one of the front facing speakers to rattle at high volume and multiple day delays clearing US customs at FedEx's Memphis, Tennessee hub due to issues related to the import paperwork.[citation needed] [ ] citation needed TheMoto X Forcewas launched on October 27, 2015. in the US, it was branded as the Droid Turbo 2, and was Motorola Mobility's flagship device of the year, offering Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of memory.

We’ve embedded AI features in many areas of our devices, like camera, battery, display and device performance. But the modern smartphone experience is going through a transformative shift, with AI at the center, serving as both a personal assistant and a tool to enhance everyday tasks, improve performance, and create more meaningful experiences for our users.That’s why, this year at Lenovo Tech World ’23, Motorola is taking its AI endeavors to another level and showcasing innovations that redefine the possibilities of flexible hardware and also introduced exciting new AI features. These features range from generative theming to a sophisticated personal assistant.Unveiling an adaptive display concept that molds to our consumer needsMotorola continues to push boundaries and invest in flexible display technology and devices. This new conceptual device uses a FHD+ pOLED display that can be bent and shaped into different forms depending on users’ needs. This adaptive display concept further builds upon the display and mechanical innovations from our foldable and rollable devices in both thesmartphone and PC categories.The adaptive display concept can be adjusted from a standard Android phone experience in a flat position to being wrapped for a wrist-worn experience or positioned in several stand modes. When laid flat, the 6.9″ display runs a full Android experience, just like any smartphone. In the upright position, the device can be adjusted into a self standing position, running a more compact form of full Android on a 4.6″ display. Users can also wrap the device around their wrist for a similar experience to the external display on motorola razr+ to stay connected while on the go.Introducing a new set of Motorola AI conceptsMotorola understands the importance of personalization for consumers. That’s why we’re committed to exploring how AI can enhance device customization to provide users with a truly one-of-kind experience. Motorola has developed a generative AI model that runs locally on the device to allow users to extend their personal style to their phone. With this concept, users can upload or capture a picture of their outfit to produce multiple unique AI-generated images that reflect their style. These images can then be used as a custom wallpaper on their device.MotoAILenovo is developing a personal assistant for both PCs and smartphones. This AI model never stops learning. It has a foundational model uniquely personalized to the user while still protecting their privacy. It also has a knowledge base that adapts to patterns and usage with natural voice or text interaction capabilities.The MotoAI concept is an innovative approach to the latest trend in AI with large language models (LLMs). Users can engage with their personal MotoAI assistant to answer questions, draft messages, schedule tasks, and so much more. While most LLMs  run cloud-based operations, MotoAI can process data and run tasks locally on-device. which offers users enhanced data privacy. MotoAI also features an on-device knowledge base where the user’s patterns and preferences inform their experience, making it more dynamic, personal, and helpful over time.2.0 Mobile Doc ScanRecognizing the growing demand for real-time document scanning on the go, Motorola has introduced an AI concept model that enhances the Doc Scanner capability currently integrated in Motorola camera systems. This innovation aims to improve final image quality by minimizing wrinkles and shadows to ensure documents or images appear as crisp and clear as possible.AI Text SummarizationMotorola is dedicated to helping users boost productivity through various applications and solutions. Our AI Text Summarization, takes longform chats, emails, or reports, and distills them down to key messages for quick comprehension.Privacy Content ObfuscationIn an era of social sharing, safeguarding user data remains paramount. Motorola’s Privacy Content Obfuscation concept leverages AI to seamlessly protect user information and privacy by intelligently identifying and blurring areas containing profile pictures and names in social posts.Looking into the futureIn a bold step toward the future, Motorola has unveiled four AI concepts that promise to redefine consumers’ daily experiences. From generative AI wallpapers that breathe life into your device’s screen, to advanced AI privacy features like blurring out sensitive information, and even the magic touch of transforming crinkled receipts into pristine documents, it’s clear convenience is at the forefront of innovation. Moreover, with the ability to effortlessly summarize notes, emails, and chats, Motorola continues to forge ahead in its mission to deliver innovative, on-the-go solutions that enhance mobility, pocketability, and overall ease for consumers.

This adaptive display concept further builds upon the display and mechanical innovations from our foldable and rollable devices in both thesmartphone and PC categories.The adaptive display concept can be adjusted from a standard Android phone experience in a flat position to being wrapped for a wrist-worn experience or positioned in several stand modes. When laid flat, the 6.9″ display runs a full Android experience, just like any smartphone. In the upright position, the device can be adjusted into a self standing position, running a more compact form of full Android on a 4.6″ display. Users can also wrap the device around their wrist for a similar experience to the external display on motorola razr+ to stay connected while on the go.Introducing a new set of Motorola AI conceptsMotorola understands the importance of personalization for consumers. That’s why we’re committed to exploring how AI can enhance device customization to provide users with a truly one-of-kind experience. Motorola has developed a generative AI model that runs locally on the device to allow users to extend their personal style to their phone.

Android™ offers a versatile and customizable platform that powers a wide range of devices, including Motorola smartphones. It provides access to a vast library of applications through the Google Play Store.Can I customize the appearance of my Motorola smartphone?Yes, you can customize the appearance of your Motorola smartphone. Android™ allows you to personalize your device by changing wallpapers, themes, icons, and even the layout of your home screen. You can also install various widgets and launchers to further enhance the customization options.Are Motorola smartphones known for their camera quality?Motorola smartphones offer a range of camera capabilities, and while they may not be the absolute best in the market, they do provide decent camera performance. Motorola devices often come equipped with advanced camera features like optical image stabilization, dual or triple camera setups, and specialized modes for capturing low-light or high-resolution images. They can capture good-quality photos and videos suitable for most everyday needs.Do Motorola smartphones support expandable storage?Yes, many Motorola smartphones support expandable storage. They typically come with a dedicated microSD card slot that allows you to increase the device's storage capacity. This is especially useful if you want to store a large number of photos, videos, or other files on your smartphone.Can I use my Motorola smartphone as a mobile hotspot?Yes, you can use your Motorola smartphone as a mobile hotspot. This feature, known as ""tethering,"" allows you to share your phone's internet connection with other devices, such as laptops or tablets, by creating a WiFi hotspot. It can come in handy when you're in a location without a WiFi network and need to connect multiple devices to the internet.Are Motorola smartphones water-resistant?Some Motorola smartphones come with water-resistant features, but it varies depending on the specific model. These devices are designed to withstand exposure to water or splashes to a certain extent. However, it's essential to check the specifications of each model to understand the level of water resistance it offers, as not all Motorola smartphones are water-resistant.What is the battery life like on Motorola smartphones?Battery life can vary depending on the specific model and individual usage patterns. However, Motorola smartphones generally offer decent battery life, allowing you to use your device throughout the day without frequent recharging. Factors like screen brightness, app usage, and network connectivity can affect battery consumption, so it's important to manage these aspects for optimal battery performance.Can I use voice commands on Motorola smartphones?Yes, you can use voice commands on Motorola smartphones. They come with built-in voice assistants like Google Assistant, which allows you to control various functions on your device using voice commands. You can ask questions, set reminders, send messages, make calls, play music, and perform other tasks without needing to type or navigate through menus manually.What is the benefit of using a Motorola smartphone with a near-stock Android™ experience?Motorola smartphones are known for providing a near-stock Android™ experience. This means that the user interface is relatively close to the default Android™ interface developed by Google. The benefit of this approach is a cleaner, more intuitive user experience with minimal bloatware or unnecessary pre-installed apps. It often results in smoother performance and quicker software updates since there is less customization to impede the deployment of new Android™ versions.Can I connect external accessories to my Motorola smartphone?Yes, you can connect external accessories to your Motorola smartphone. Most Motorola devices come with standard connectivity options such as Bluetooth®, universal serial bus (USB), and WiFi, allowing you to pair and use various peripherals. You can connect wireless headphones, speakers, smartwatches, keyboards, or mice, as well as transfer data to and from your smartphone using USB cables or wirelessly through Wi-Fi.What are Moto Mods?Moto Mods are modular accessories designed specifically for Motorola smartphones. They attach to the back of the phone using magnets or a secure connection and provide additional functionality or customization options. Examples of Moto Mods include camera attachments, battery packs, speakers, gamepad controllers, and projectors.

Companies like Xiaomi, Poco, redmi, ulefone, ZTE etc etc are all just as bad. And then you get companies like oppo, who are getting better with updates (although that's subjective) and then they decide to not release a flagship like the x6 pro globally 🤦‍♂️.

Plus, the Razr is back.Save this storySaveSave this storySaveIf someone askedwhat kind of pet you want, you’d probably say a cat or a dog. In this analogy, Motorola phones are hamsters. They're still cute and definitelypets, but not necessarily the first or second one that comes to mind. The company’s Android smartphones often play third (or fourth) fiddle to the likes of Samsung and Google. If you’re an interested buyer, picking the best Motorola phone can be tough because the company launches many models in a year. I’ve tested almost every one of them, and in this guide, I break down the pros and cons and steer you toward my favorite Moto models—including the folding Razr+ flip phone.Be sure to check out our other mobilebuying guides, including theBest Android Phones,Best iPhones,Best Cheap Phones,Best Pixel Phones, andBest Phones With a Headphone Jack.Updated July 2024: We've added the Motorola Edge, Razr, and Razr+.Table of ContentsThe Pros and Cons of Buying a MotorolaTheBest Motorola Phone:Motorola Razr+A Good Midrange Motorola:Motorola Edge 2024Best Moto G Phone:Moto G Power 5G 2024If You Want a Stylus:Moto G Stylus 5G 2024Other Good Motorola PhonesAvoid These PhonesThe CompetitionOur Favorite Motorola FeaturesPower up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year.

This breakdown can help you decide whether to stick with Moto or buy something else.What’s WIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola phones have a simple Android interface.This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it.They have some of the best battery life.The company stuffs big batteries into these slim phones, and they’re frequently able to eke out close to two full days of use on a single charge with average use, besting almost all of the competition. Motorola's 2024 devices aren't as long-lasting as before but they can still go more than a day.There’s broad carrier support.While some Android phones have inconsistent carrier support in the US, Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company listscarrier support detailsin the Specs section of all its phones). They all work on the big three—T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. Make sure you buy them unlocked.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe prices dip quite often.Never buy a Motorola phone at its MSRP. They almost always go on sale a few months (or weeks) after launch, sometimes at steep discounts.What’s TIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola’s software updates are lackluster.The company is slowly improving here—it promises to deliver three Android OS updates and four years of bimonthly security updates to its high-end smartphones—but it stilllags behind its peers. Worse yet, the phones in the Moto G series only receive one OS Android update (with three years of security updates), so they miss out onnew Android featuresquickly. Even if a phone is promised updates, they take alongtime to arrive.Most Moto G phones lack NFC.Near-field communication sensors are what enabletap-to-pay on your phone, allowing you to use contactless payments at participating retailers. Phones ascheap as $200have this feature, but Motorola has long excluded it on (most) of its Moto G range. This is starting to change, with many of the 2024 Moto G models sporting NFC.The cameras are lackluster.Among the things putting Motorola behind the likes of Samsung and Google are the cameras. They can takefinephotos, but they’re easily eclipsed by the competition. There's some improvement here but only in the high-end devices.There’s no always-on display.Most Android phones have a settingyou can toggle onif you want an always-on display that will show a clock on your screen even when the screen is “off.” Motorola has Peek Display, which requires you to move the phone or tap the screen to see anything. It’s not a big deal, but that’s a feature you might miss if you’re coming from another phone. The 2024 Razr devices finally break the mold with always-on displays.The Best Motorola PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr+ (2024)$1,000at Amazon$1,000at Best Buy$1,000at MotorolaIf you're going to buy a Motorola and money isn't much of a concern, itshouldbe a statement phone like the Razr+ (2024). This third-gen folding flip smartphone (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is much more refined, adding features you've come to expect in a modern-day handset, like anIPX8 water resistancerating that keeps it safe from dips in the pool and a bright165-HzOLED screen that is easy to read in sunny conditions. And yes, you can flip open the phone to answer a call and flip it shut to end it.When it’s closed, the enlarged 4-inch OLED cover screen can show you notifications, apps, and handy widgets to check the weather, calendar events, and news. It even lets you play some fun mini-games. You can also use the superior primary cameras—which would typically be on the “back” of the phone but are now at the front—to snap selfies and see previews on this external screen. They’re some of the sharpest selfies you’ll snap.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOpen it up and you have a 6.9-inch screen that functions like a standard phone. There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor compared to the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devices. That said, performance was smooth for me, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage.This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results.I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so.There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. There will likely be a decent discount in a few months; last year's Razr+ stayed at $700 for almost half its shelf life.Motorola promises three Android OS upgrades and four years of bimonthly security updates.★ A Cheaper FoldPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at MotorolaThis is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, and you'll likely see it dip to $500 in a few months. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.A Good Midrange MotorolaPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Edge (2024)$582at Amazon$550at Best Buy$550at MotorolaIf you're looking for a smartphone around the $500 mark, I'd first steer you toward theGoogle Pixel 8A. Not your jam? Then Motorola's 2024 Edge is a pretty good alternative. It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay.It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonI do have a few gripes though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal. It's worth noting that since Motorola phones go on saleveryoften, I'd wait to nab the Edge until it starts dipping below $500.Motorola promises two Android OS upgrades and three years of bimonthly security updates.Best Moto G PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G 5G Power (2024)$300$250at Amazon$300$250at Best Buy$300$250at MotorolaThis is the best Moto G phone Motorola has ever made (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For under $300, you get a lovely phone with a nice vegan leather textured back that resists fingerprints. The 6.7-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and even wireless charging. It's almost unheard of to see wireless charging on a sub-$400 smartphone, but here we are. More surprising is how this low-priced Moto G finally supports NFC, meaning you can tap to pay anywhere it's supported. Ditch the cableandthe wallet!The Moto G Power 2024 is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7020 chipset with 8 GB of RAM. While you will see some slowdowns here and there, it's generally smooth sailing. I used it for nearly a month with no qualms, juggling between my favorite apps, navigating, streaming music, and taking pictures. The 5,000-mAh battery doesn't last as long as previous Moto G Powers—you can easily get a full day out of it, and a little extra if you're conservative.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera and an 8-MP ultrawide, and they're adequate. It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power. It's just as nice with the vegan leather back and delivers relatively smooth performance with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset and 8 gigs of RAM. Sure, there are some hiccups here and there, particularly when you juggle between apps, but it's an otherwise snappy phone.For $100 more than its sibling, youdoget some extra perks. Namely, the stylus. You can pull it out of the bottom of the phone to jot notes, sign documents, or doodle when bored. Motorola doesn't have decent palm rejection, so don't expect comfortable sketching sessions on this handset, but it's handy to have around for those reasons.I eked out slightly better battery life, despite the same 5,000-mAh capacity as the Moto G Power 2024. It comfortably lasted a full day with heavy use, and a day and a half for average use. There's still wireless charging, a headphone jack, NFC for contactless payments, and the same size 6.7-inch screen, though here you're treated to a superior OLED panel that offers deeper blacks and richer colors. The screen hasa 120-Hz refresh rate, just like the Moto G Power.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOther upgrades include a bump to 256 GB of internal storage,dualstereo speakers, and a nicer camera system: a 50-MP main camera with a 13-MP ultrawide, plus a 32-MP selfie camera. The cameras are better than what you get on the Moto G Power, with more vibrant colors and sharper details, especially with the ultrawide. However, it's still not as good as theGoogle Pixel 8A.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.Other Good Motorola PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuI suggest you stick to the phones above, but if your budget is tight, the phones below are OK buys. The Moto G phones receive one Android OS update and three years of bimonthly security updates.Motorola Edge 2023 for $350:Last year's 6.7-inch Motorola remains a good buy, especially at this price. You get an OLED screen, a165-Hz screen refresh rate, and pretty good performance with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, a flagship-grade processor. It's well-rounded with IP68 water resistance, 512 GB of storage, and a 5,100-mAh battery that can last two full days on average. The camera is just OK, but this device will get two more Android OS upgrades and three more years of security updates, which is more than many of the devices below.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonMoto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivered reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate.Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £600:The new Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a midrange contender with a triple-lens camera, silky smooth screen, and lightning-fast wired and wireless charging in a compact waterproof body, but limited software updates and a lack of processing power let it down. Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans.Avoid These PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuYou should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier. They won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.Moto G 5G 2024 for $200:I wouldn't bother with this Moto G. The performance is just too sluggish and the cameras are noticeably worse than the Moto G Power 5G. Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500). If you want to spend as little as possible, then theGalaxy A35 5G ($400)is another alternative.Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options.Our Favorite Motorola FeaturesPhotograph: MotorolaMoto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files.

This breakdown can help you decide whether to stick with Moto or buy something else.What’s WIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola phones have a simple Android interface.This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it.They have some of the best battery life.The company stuffs big batteries into these slim phones, and they’re frequently able to eke out close to two full days of use on a single charge with average use, besting almost all of the competition. Motorola's 2024 devices aren't as long-lasting as before but they can still go more than a day.There’s broad carrier support.While some Android phones have inconsistent carrier support in the US, Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company listscarrier support detailsin the Specs section of all its phones). They all work on the big three—T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. Make sure you buy them unlocked.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe prices dip quite often.Never buy a Motorola phone at its MSRP. They almost always go on sale a few months (or weeks) after launch, sometimes at steep discounts.What’s TIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola’s software updates are lackluster.The company is slowly improving here—it promises to deliver three Android OS updates and four years of bimonthly security updates to its high-end smartphones—but it stilllags behind its peers. Worse yet, the phones in the Moto G series only receive one OS Android update (with three years of security updates), so they miss out onnew Android featuresquickly. Even if a phone is promised updates, they take alongtime to arrive.Most Moto G phones lack NFC.Near-field communication sensors are what enabletap-to-pay on your phone, allowing you to use contactless payments at participating retailers. Phones ascheap as $200have this feature, but Motorola has long excluded it on (most) of its Moto G range. This is starting to change, with many of the 2024 Moto G models sporting NFC.The cameras are lackluster.Among the things putting Motorola behind the likes of Samsung and Google are the cameras. They can takefinephotos, but they’re easily eclipsed by the competition. There's some improvement here but only in the high-end devices.There’s no always-on display.Most Android phones have a settingyou can toggle onif you want an always-on display that will show a clock on your screen even when the screen is “off.” Motorola has Peek Display, which requires you to move the phone or tap the screen to see anything. It’s not a big deal, but that’s a feature you might miss if you’re coming from another phone. The 2024 Razr devices finally break the mold with always-on displays.The Best Motorola PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr+ (2024)$1,000at Amazon$1,000at Best Buy$1,000at MotorolaIf you're going to buy a Motorola and money isn't much of a concern, itshouldbe a statement phone like the Razr+ (2024). This third-gen folding flip smartphone (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is much more refined, adding features you've come to expect in a modern-day handset, like anIPX8 water resistancerating that keeps it safe from dips in the pool and a bright165-HzOLED screen that is easy to read in sunny conditions. And yes, you can flip open the phone to answer a call and flip it shut to end it.When it’s closed, the enlarged 4-inch OLED cover screen can show you notifications, apps, and handy widgets to check the weather, calendar events, and news. It even lets you play some fun mini-games. You can also use the superior primary cameras—which would typically be on the “back” of the phone but are now at the front—to snap selfies and see previews on this external screen. They’re some of the sharpest selfies you’ll snap.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOpen it up and you have a 6.9-inch screen that functions like a standard phone. There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor compared to the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devices. That said, performance was smooth for me, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage.This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results.I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so.There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. There will likely be a decent discount in a few months; last year's Razr+ stayed at $700 for almost half its shelf life.Motorola promises three Android OS upgrades and four years of bimonthly security updates.★ A Cheaper FoldPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at MotorolaThis is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, and you'll likely see it dip to $500 in a few months. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.A Good Midrange MotorolaPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Edge (2024)$582at Amazon$550at Best Buy$550at MotorolaIf you're looking for a smartphone around the $500 mark, I'd first steer you toward theGoogle Pixel 8A. Not your jam? Then Motorola's 2024 Edge is a pretty good alternative. It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay.It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonI do have a few gripes though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal. It's worth noting that since Motorola phones go on saleveryoften, I'd wait to nab the Edge until it starts dipping below $500.Motorola promises two Android OS upgrades and three years of bimonthly security updates.Best Moto G PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G 5G Power (2024)$300$250at Amazon$300$250at Best Buy$300$250at MotorolaThis is the best Moto G phone Motorola has ever made (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For under $300, you get a lovely phone with a nice vegan leather textured back that resists fingerprints. The 6.7-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and even wireless charging. It's almost unheard of to see wireless charging on a sub-$400 smartphone, but here we are. More surprising is how this low-priced Moto G finally supports NFC, meaning you can tap to pay anywhere it's supported. Ditch the cableandthe wallet!The Moto G Power 2024 is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7020 chipset with 8 GB of RAM. While you will see some slowdowns here and there, it's generally smooth sailing. I used it for nearly a month with no qualms, juggling between my favorite apps, navigating, streaming music, and taking pictures. The 5,000-mAh battery doesn't last as long as previous Moto G Powers—you can easily get a full day out of it, and a little extra if you're conservative.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera and an 8-MP ultrawide, and they're adequate. It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power. It's just as nice with the vegan leather back and delivers relatively smooth performance with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset and 8 gigs of RAM. Sure, there are some hiccups here and there, particularly when you juggle between apps, but it's an otherwise snappy phone.For $100 more than its sibling, youdoget some extra perks. Namely, the stylus. You can pull it out of the bottom of the phone to jot notes, sign documents, or doodle when bored. Motorola doesn't have decent palm rejection, so don't expect comfortable sketching sessions on this handset, but it's handy to have around for those reasons.I eked out slightly better battery life, despite the same 5,000-mAh capacity as the Moto G Power 2024. It comfortably lasted a full day with heavy use, and a day and a half for average use. There's still wireless charging, a headphone jack, NFC for contactless payments, and the same size 6.7-inch screen, though here you're treated to a superior OLED panel that offers deeper blacks and richer colors. The screen hasa 120-Hz refresh rate, just like the Moto G Power.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOther upgrades include a bump to 256 GB of internal storage,dualstereo speakers, and a nicer camera system: a 50-MP main camera with a 13-MP ultrawide, plus a 32-MP selfie camera. The cameras are better than what you get on the Moto G Power, with more vibrant colors and sharper details, especially with the ultrawide. However, it's still not as good as theGoogle Pixel 8A.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.Other Good Motorola PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuI suggest you stick to the phones above, but if your budget is tight, the phones below are OK buys. The Moto G phones receive one Android OS update and three years of bimonthly security updates.Motorola Edge 2023 for $350:Last year's 6.7-inch Motorola remains a good buy, especially at this price. You get an OLED screen, a165-Hz screen refresh rate, and pretty good performance with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, a flagship-grade processor. It's well-rounded with IP68 water resistance, 512 GB of storage, and a 5,100-mAh battery that can last two full days on average. The camera is just OK, but this device will get two more Android OS upgrades and three more years of security updates, which is more than many of the devices below.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonMoto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivered reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate.Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £600:The new Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a midrange contender with a triple-lens camera, silky smooth screen, and lightning-fast wired and wireless charging in a compact waterproof body, but limited software updates and a lack of processing power let it down. Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans.Avoid These PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuYou should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier. They won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.Moto G 5G 2024 for $200:I wouldn't bother with this Moto G. The performance is just too sluggish and the cameras are noticeably worse than the Moto G Power 5G. Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500). If you want to spend as little as possible, then theGalaxy A35 5G ($400)is another alternative.Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options.Our Favorite Motorola FeaturesPhotograph: MotorolaMoto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Ready For. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only), or theReady For Assistantif you’re connecting an Android tablet.

Even if a phone is promised updates, they take alongtime to arrive.Most Moto G phones lack NFC.Near-field communication sensors are what enabletap-to-pay on your phone, allowing you to use contactless payments at participating retailers. Phones ascheap as $200have this feature, but Motorola has long excluded it on (most) of its Moto G range. This is starting to change, with many of the 2024 Moto G models sporting NFC.The cameras are lackluster.Among the things putting Motorola behind the likes of Samsung and Google are the cameras. They can takefinephotos, but they’re easily eclipsed by the competition. There's some improvement here but only in the high-end devices.There’s no always-on display.Most Android phones have a settingyou can toggle onif you want an always-on display that will show a clock on your screen even when the screen is “off.” Motorola has Peek Display, which requires you to move the phone or tap the screen to see anything. It’s not a big deal, but that’s a feature you might miss if you’re coming from another phone. The 2024 Razr devices finally break the mold with always-on displays.The Best Motorola PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr+ (2024)$1,000at Amazon$1,000at Best Buy$1,000at MotorolaIf you're going to buy a Motorola and money isn't much of a concern, itshouldbe a statement phone like the Razr+ (2024). This third-gen folding flip smartphone (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is much more refined, adding features you've come to expect in a modern-day handset, like anIPX8 water resistancerating that keeps it safe from dips in the pool and a bright165-HzOLED screen that is easy to read in sunny conditions. And yes, you can flip open the phone to answer a call and flip it shut to end it.When it’s closed, the enlarged 4-inch OLED cover screen can show you notifications, apps, and handy widgets to check the weather, calendar events, and news. It even lets you play some fun mini-games. You can also use the superior primary cameras—which would typically be on the “back” of the phone but are now at the front—to snap selfies and see previews on this external screen. They’re some of the sharpest selfies you’ll snap.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOpen it up and you have a 6.9-inch screen that functions like a standard phone. There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor compared to the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devices. That said, performance was smooth for me, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage.This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results.I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so.There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. There will likely be a decent discount in a few months; last year's Razr+ stayed at $700 for almost half its shelf life.Motorola promises three Android OS upgrades and four years of bimonthly security updates.★ A Cheaper FoldPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at MotorolaThis is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, and you'll likely see it dip to $500 in a few months. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.A Good Midrange MotorolaPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Edge (2024)$582at Amazon$550at Best Buy$550at MotorolaIf you're looking for a smartphone around the $500 mark, I'd first steer you toward theGoogle Pixel 8A. Not your jam? Then Motorola's 2024 Edge is a pretty good alternative. It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay.It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonI do have a few gripes though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal. It's worth noting that since Motorola phones go on saleveryoften, I'd wait to nab the Edge until it starts dipping below $500.Motorola promises two Android OS upgrades and three years of bimonthly security updates.Best Moto G PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G 5G Power (2024)$300$250at Amazon$300$250at Best Buy$300$250at MotorolaThis is the best Moto G phone Motorola has ever made (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For under $300, you get a lovely phone with a nice vegan leather textured back that resists fingerprints. The 6.7-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and even wireless charging. It's almost unheard of to see wireless charging on a sub-$400 smartphone, but here we are. More surprising is how this low-priced Moto G finally supports NFC, meaning you can tap to pay anywhere it's supported. Ditch the cableandthe wallet!The Moto G Power 2024 is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7020 chipset with 8 GB of RAM. While you will see some slowdowns here and there, it's generally smooth sailing. I used it for nearly a month with no qualms, juggling between my favorite apps, navigating, streaming music, and taking pictures. The 5,000-mAh battery doesn't last as long as previous Moto G Powers—you can easily get a full day out of it, and a little extra if you're conservative.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera and an 8-MP ultrawide, and they're adequate. It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power. It's just as nice with the vegan leather back and delivers relatively smooth performance with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset and 8 gigs of RAM. Sure, there are some hiccups here and there, particularly when you juggle between apps, but it's an otherwise snappy phone.For $100 more than its sibling, youdoget some extra perks. Namely, the stylus. You can pull it out of the bottom of the phone to jot notes, sign documents, or doodle when bored. Motorola doesn't have decent palm rejection, so don't expect comfortable sketching sessions on this handset, but it's handy to have around for those reasons.I eked out slightly better battery life, despite the same 5,000-mAh capacity as the Moto G Power 2024. It comfortably lasted a full day with heavy use, and a day and a half for average use. There's still wireless charging, a headphone jack, NFC for contactless payments, and the same size 6.7-inch screen, though here you're treated to a superior OLED panel that offers deeper blacks and richer colors. The screen hasa 120-Hz refresh rate, just like the Moto G Power.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOther upgrades include a bump to 256 GB of internal storage,dualstereo speakers, and a nicer camera system: a 50-MP main camera with a 13-MP ultrawide, plus a 32-MP selfie camera. The cameras are better than what you get on the Moto G Power, with more vibrant colors and sharper details, especially with the ultrawide. However, it's still not as good as theGoogle Pixel 8A.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.Other Good Motorola PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuI suggest you stick to the phones above, but if your budget is tight, the phones below are OK buys. The Moto G phones receive one Android OS update and three years of bimonthly security updates.Motorola Edge 2023 for $350:Last year's 6.7-inch Motorola remains a good buy, especially at this price. You get an OLED screen, a165-Hz screen refresh rate, and pretty good performance with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, a flagship-grade processor. It's well-rounded with IP68 water resistance, 512 GB of storage, and a 5,100-mAh battery that can last two full days on average. The camera is just OK, but this device will get two more Android OS upgrades and three more years of security updates, which is more than many of the devices below.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonMoto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivered reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate.Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £600:The new Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a midrange contender with a triple-lens camera, silky smooth screen, and lightning-fast wired and wireless charging in a compact waterproof body, but limited software updates and a lack of processing power let it down. Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans.Avoid These PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuYou should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier. They won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.Moto G 5G 2024 for $200:I wouldn't bother with this Moto G. The performance is just too sluggish and the cameras are noticeably worse than the Moto G Power 5G. Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500). If you want to spend as little as possible, then theGalaxy A35 5G ($400)is another alternative.Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options.Our Favorite Motorola FeaturesPhotograph: MotorolaMoto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Ready For. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only), or theReady For Assistantif you’re connecting an Android tablet.

This breakdown can help you decide whether to stick with Moto or buy something else.What’s WIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola phones have a simple Android interface.This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it.They have some of the best battery life.The company stuffs big batteries into these slim phones, and they’re frequently able to eke out close to two full days of use on a single charge with average use, besting almost all of the competition. Motorola's 2024 devices aren't as long-lasting as before but they can still go more than a day.There’s broad carrier support.While some Android phones have inconsistent carrier support in the US, Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company listscarrier support detailsin the Specs section of all its phones). They all work on the big three—T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon.

It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay.It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonI do have a few gripes though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal. It's worth noting that since Motorola phones go on saleveryoften, I'd wait to nab the Edge until it starts dipping below $500.Motorola promises two Android OS upgrades and three years of bimonthly security updates.Best Moto G PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G 5G Power (2024)$300$250at Amazon$300$250at Best Buy$300$250at MotorolaThis is the best Moto G phone Motorola has ever made (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For under $300, you get a lovely phone with a nice vegan leather textured back that resists fingerprints. The 6.7-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and even wireless charging. It's almost unheard of to see wireless charging on a sub-$400 smartphone, but here we are. More surprising is how this low-priced Moto G finally supports NFC, meaning you can tap to pay anywhere it's supported. Ditch the cableandthe wallet!The Moto G Power 2024 is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7020 chipset with 8 GB of RAM. While you will see some slowdowns here and there, it's generally smooth sailing. I used it for nearly a month with no qualms, juggling between my favorite apps, navigating, streaming music, and taking pictures. The 5,000-mAh battery doesn't last as long as previous Moto G Powers—you can easily get a full day out of it, and a little extra if you're conservative.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera and an 8-MP ultrawide, and they're adequate. It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power.

It comfortably lasted a full day with heavy use, and a day and a half for average use. There's still wireless charging, a headphone jack, NFC for contactless payments, and the same size 6.7-inch screen, though here you're treated to a superior OLED panel that offers deeper blacks and richer colors.

It's well-rounded with IP68 water resistance, 512 GB of storage, and a 5,100-mAh battery that can last two full days on average. The camera is just OK, but this device will get two more Android OS upgrades and three more years of security updates, which is more than many of the devices below.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonMoto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update.

Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans.Avoid These PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuYou should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier. They won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.Moto G 5G 2024 for $200:I wouldn't bother with this Moto G. The performance is just too sluggish and the cameras are noticeably worse than the Moto G Power 5G. Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500). If you want to spend as little as possible, then theGalaxy A35 5G ($400)is another alternative.Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options.Our Favorite Motorola FeaturesPhotograph: MotorolaMoto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Ready For. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only), or theReady For Assistantif you’re connecting an Android tablet. If you’re using a TV, it needsMiracast supportto connect wirelessly, but you can use a USB-C or HDMI cable as well.

Save this storySaveSave this storySaveIf someone askedwhat kind of pet you want, you’d probably say a cat or a dog. In this analogy, Motorola phones are hamsters. They're still cute and definitelypets, but not necessarily the first or second one that comes to mind. The company’s Android smartphones often play third (or fourth) fiddle to the likes of Samsung and Google. If you’re an interested buyer, picking the best Motorola phone can be tough because the company launches many models in a year. I’ve tested almost every one of them, and in this guide, I break down the pros and cons and steer you toward my favorite Moto models—including the folding Razr+ flip phone.Be sure to check out our other mobilebuying guides, including theBest Android Phones,Best iPhones,Best Cheap Phones,Best Pixel Phones, andBest Phones With a Headphone Jack.Updated July 2024: We've added the Motorola Edge, Razr, and Razr+.Table of ContentsThe Pros and Cons of Buying a MotorolaTheBest Motorola Phone:Motorola Razr+A Good Midrange Motorola:Motorola Edge 2024Best Moto G Phone:Moto G Power 5G 2024If You Want a Stylus:Moto G Stylus 5G 2024Other Good Motorola PhonesAvoid These PhonesThe CompetitionOur Favorite Motorola FeaturesPower up with unlimited access toWIRED.Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just$2.50$1 per month for 1 year.

This breakdown can help you decide whether to stick with Moto or buy something else.What’s WIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola phones have a simple Android interface.This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it.They have some of the best battery life.The company stuffs big batteries into these slim phones, and they’re frequently able to eke out close to two full days of use on a single charge with average use, besting almost all of the competition. Motorola's 2024 devices aren't as long-lasting as before but they can still go more than a day.There’s broad carrier support.While some Android phones have inconsistent carrier support in the US, Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company listscarrier support detailsin the Specs section of all its phones). They all work on the big three—T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. Make sure you buy them unlocked.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe prices dip quite often.Never buy a Motorola phone at its MSRP. They almost always go on sale a few months (or weeks) after launch, sometimes at steep discounts.What’s TIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola’s software updates are lackluster.The company is slowly improving here—it promises to deliver three Android OS updates and four years of bimonthly security updates to its high-end smartphones—but it stilllags behind its peers. Worse yet, the phones in the Moto G series only receive one OS Android update (with three years of security updates), so they miss out onnew Android featuresquickly. Even if a phone is promised updates, they take alongtime to arrive.Most Moto G phones lack NFC.Near-field communication sensors are what enabletap-to-pay on your phone, allowing you to use contactless payments at participating retailers. Phones ascheap as $200have this feature, but Motorola has long excluded it on (most) of its Moto G range. This is starting to change, with many of the 2024 Moto G models sporting NFC.The cameras are lackluster.Among the things putting Motorola behind the likes of Samsung and Google are the cameras. They can takefinephotos, but they’re easily eclipsed by the competition. There's some improvement here but only in the high-end devices.There’s no always-on display.Most Android phones have a settingyou can toggle onif you want an always-on display that will show a clock on your screen even when the screen is “off.” Motorola has Peek Display, which requires you to move the phone or tap the screen to see anything. It’s not a big deal, but that’s a feature you might miss if you’re coming from another phone. The 2024 Razr devices finally break the mold with always-on displays.The Best Motorola PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr+ (2024)$1,000at Amazon$1,000at Best Buy$1,000at MotorolaIf you're going to buy a Motorola and money isn't much of a concern, itshouldbe a statement phone like the Razr+ (2024). This third-gen folding flip smartphone (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is much more refined, adding features you've come to expect in a modern-day handset, like anIPX8 water resistancerating that keeps it safe from dips in the pool and a bright165-HzOLED screen that is easy to read in sunny conditions. And yes, you can flip open the phone to answer a call and flip it shut to end it.When it’s closed, the enlarged 4-inch OLED cover screen can show you notifications, apps, and handy widgets to check the weather, calendar events, and news. It even lets you play some fun mini-games. You can also use the superior primary cameras—which would typically be on the “back” of the phone but are now at the front—to snap selfies and see previews on this external screen. They’re some of the sharpest selfies you’ll snap.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOpen it up and you have a 6.9-inch screen that functions like a standard phone. There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor compared to the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devices. That said, performance was smooth for me, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage.This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results.I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so.There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. There will likely be a decent discount in a few months; last year's Razr+ stayed at $700 for almost half its shelf life.Motorola promises three Android OS upgrades and four years of bimonthly security updates.★ A Cheaper FoldPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at MotorolaThis is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, and you'll likely see it dip to $500 in a few months. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.A Good Midrange MotorolaPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Edge (2024)$582at Amazon$550at Best Buy$550at MotorolaIf you're looking for a smartphone around the $500 mark, I'd first steer you toward theGoogle Pixel 8A.

The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.Moto G 5G 2024 for $200:I wouldn't bother with this Moto G. The performance is just too sluggish and the cameras are noticeably worse than the Moto G Power 5G. Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500).

They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Ready For. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only), or theReady For Assistantif you’re connecting an Android tablet.

They almost always go on sale a few months (or weeks) after launch, sometimes at steep discounts.What’s TIRED About Motorola PhonesMotorola’s software updates are lackluster.The company is slowly improving here—it promises to deliver three Android OS updates and four years of bimonthly security updates to its high-end smartphones—but it stilllags behind its peers. Worse yet, the phones in the Moto G series only receive one OS Android update (with three years of security updates), so they miss out onnew Android featuresquickly. Even if a phone is promised updates, they take alongtime to arrive.Most Moto G phones lack NFC.Near-field communication sensors are what enabletap-to-pay on your phone, allowing you to use contactless payments at participating retailers. Phones ascheap as $200have this feature, but Motorola has long excluded it on (most) of its Moto G range.

They can takefinephotos, but they’re easily eclipsed by the competition. There's some improvement here but only in the high-end devices.There’s no always-on display.Most Android phones have a settingyou can toggle onif you want an always-on display that will show a clock on your screen even when the screen is “off.” Motorola has Peek Display, which requires you to move the phone or tap the screen to see anything. It’s not a big deal, but that’s a feature you might miss if you’re coming from another phone. The 2024 Razr devices finally break the mold with always-on displays.The Best Motorola PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr+ (2024)$1,000at Amazon$1,000at Best Buy$1,000at MotorolaIf you're going to buy a Motorola and money isn't much of a concern, itshouldbe a statement phone like the Razr+ (2024). This third-gen folding flip smartphone (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is much more refined, adding features you've come to expect in a modern-day handset, like anIPX8 water resistancerating that keeps it safe from dips in the pool and a bright165-HzOLED screen that is easy to read in sunny conditions. And yes, you can flip open the phone to answer a call and flip it shut to end it.When it’s closed, the enlarged 4-inch OLED cover screen can show you notifications, apps, and handy widgets to check the weather, calendar events, and news. It even lets you play some fun mini-games. You can also use the superior primary cameras—which would typically be on the “back” of the phone but are now at the front—to snap selfies and see previews on this external screen. They’re some of the sharpest selfies you’ll snap.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOpen it up and you have a 6.9-inch screen that functions like a standard phone. There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor compared to the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devices. That said, performance was smooth for me, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage.This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results.I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so.There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. There will likely be a decent discount in a few months; last year's Razr+ stayed at $700 for almost half its shelf life.Motorola promises three Android OS upgrades and four years of bimonthly security updates.★ A Cheaper FoldPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at MotorolaThis is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, and you'll likely see it dip to $500 in a few months. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.A Good Midrange MotorolaPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Edge (2024)$582at Amazon$550at Best Buy$550at MotorolaIf you're looking for a smartphone around the $500 mark, I'd first steer you toward theGoogle Pixel 8A. Not your jam? Then Motorola's 2024 Edge is a pretty good alternative. It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay.It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonI do have a few gripes though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal. It's worth noting that since Motorola phones go on saleveryoften, I'd wait to nab the Edge until it starts dipping below $500.Motorola promises two Android OS upgrades and three years of bimonthly security updates.Best Moto G PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G 5G Power (2024)$300$250at Amazon$300$250at Best Buy$300$250at MotorolaThis is the best Moto G phone Motorola has ever made (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For under $300, you get a lovely phone with a nice vegan leather textured back that resists fingerprints. The 6.7-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and even wireless charging. It's almost unheard of to see wireless charging on a sub-$400 smartphone, but here we are. More surprising is how this low-priced Moto G finally supports NFC, meaning you can tap to pay anywhere it's supported. Ditch the cableandthe wallet!The Moto G Power 2024 is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7020 chipset with 8 GB of RAM. While you will see some slowdowns here and there, it's generally smooth sailing. I used it for nearly a month with no qualms, juggling between my favorite apps, navigating, streaming music, and taking pictures. The 5,000-mAh battery doesn't last as long as previous Moto G Powers—you can easily get a full day out of it, and a little extra if you're conservative.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera and an 8-MP ultrawide, and they're adequate. It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power. It's just as nice with the vegan leather back and delivers relatively smooth performance with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset and 8 gigs of RAM. Sure, there are some hiccups here and there, particularly when you juggle between apps, but it's an otherwise snappy phone.For $100 more than its sibling, youdoget some extra perks. Namely, the stylus. You can pull it out of the bottom of the phone to jot notes, sign documents, or doodle when bored. Motorola doesn't have decent palm rejection, so don't expect comfortable sketching sessions on this handset, but it's handy to have around for those reasons.I eked out slightly better battery life, despite the same 5,000-mAh capacity as the Moto G Power 2024. It comfortably lasted a full day with heavy use, and a day and a half for average use. There's still wireless charging, a headphone jack, NFC for contactless payments, and the same size 6.7-inch screen, though here you're treated to a superior OLED panel that offers deeper blacks and richer colors. The screen hasa 120-Hz refresh rate, just like the Moto G Power.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOther upgrades include a bump to 256 GB of internal storage,dualstereo speakers, and a nicer camera system: a 50-MP main camera with a 13-MP ultrawide, plus a 32-MP selfie camera. The cameras are better than what you get on the Moto G Power, with more vibrant colors and sharper details, especially with the ultrawide. However, it's still not as good as theGoogle Pixel 8A.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.Other Good Motorola PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuI suggest you stick to the phones above, but if your budget is tight, the phones below are OK buys. The Moto G phones receive one Android OS update and three years of bimonthly security updates.Motorola Edge 2023 for $350:Last year's 6.7-inch Motorola remains a good buy, especially at this price. You get an OLED screen, a165-Hz screen refresh rate, and pretty good performance with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, a flagship-grade processor. It's well-rounded with IP68 water resistance, 512 GB of storage, and a 5,100-mAh battery that can last two full days on average. The camera is just OK, but this device will get two more Android OS upgrades and three more years of security updates, which is more than many of the devices below.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonMoto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivered reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate.Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £600:The new Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a midrange contender with a triple-lens camera, silky smooth screen, and lightning-fast wired and wireless charging in a compact waterproof body, but limited software updates and a lack of processing power let it down. Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans.Avoid These PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuYou should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier.

Not your jam? Then Motorola's 2024 Edge is a pretty good alternative. It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay.It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonI do have a few gripes though. The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal. It's worth noting that since Motorola phones go on saleveryoften, I'd wait to nab the Edge until it starts dipping below $500.Motorola promises two Android OS upgrades and three years of bimonthly security updates.Best Moto G PhonePhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G 5G Power (2024)$300$250at Amazon$300$250at Best Buy$300$250at MotorolaThis is the best Moto G phone Motorola has ever made (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For under $300, you get a lovely phone with a nice vegan leather textured back that resists fingerprints. The 6.7-inch LCD is sharp and bright, and you get a fingerprint scanner, a 3.5-mm headphone jack, and even wireless charging. It's almost unheard of to see wireless charging on a sub-$400 smartphone, but here we are. More surprising is how this low-priced Moto G finally supports NFC, meaning you can tap to pay anywhere it's supported. Ditch the cableandthe wallet!The Moto G Power 2024 is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 7020 chipset with 8 GB of RAM. While you will see some slowdowns here and there, it's generally smooth sailing. I used it for nearly a month with no qualms, juggling between my favorite apps, navigating, streaming music, and taking pictures. The 5,000-mAh battery doesn't last as long as previous Moto G Powers—you can easily get a full day out of it, and a little extra if you're conservative.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonThe camera system consists of a 50-megapixel main camera and an 8-MP ultrawide, and they're adequate. It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power. It's just as nice with the vegan leather back and delivers relatively smooth performance with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 chipset and 8 gigs of RAM. Sure, there are some hiccups here and there, particularly when you juggle between apps, but it's an otherwise snappy phone.For $100 more than its sibling, youdoget some extra perks. Namely, the stylus. You can pull it out of the bottom of the phone to jot notes, sign documents, or doodle when bored. Motorola doesn't have decent palm rejection, so don't expect comfortable sketching sessions on this handset, but it's handy to have around for those reasons.I eked out slightly better battery life, despite the same 5,000-mAh capacity as the Moto G Power 2024. It comfortably lasted a full day with heavy use, and a day and a half for average use. There's still wireless charging, a headphone jack, NFC for contactless payments, and the same size 6.7-inch screen, though here you're treated to a superior OLED panel that offers deeper blacks and richer colors. The screen hasa 120-Hz refresh rate, just like the Moto G Power.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonOther upgrades include a bump to 256 GB of internal storage,dualstereo speakers, and a nicer camera system: a 50-MP main camera with a 13-MP ultrawide, plus a 32-MP selfie camera. The cameras are better than what you get on the Moto G Power, with more vibrant colors and sharper details, especially with the ultrawide. However, it's still not as good as theGoogle Pixel 8A.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.Other Good Motorola PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuI suggest you stick to the phones above, but if your budget is tight, the phones below are OK buys. The Moto G phones receive one Android OS update and three years of bimonthly security updates.Motorola Edge 2023 for $350:Last year's 6.7-inch Motorola remains a good buy, especially at this price. You get an OLED screen, a165-Hz screen refresh rate, and pretty good performance with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, a flagship-grade processor. It's well-rounded with IP68 water resistance, 512 GB of storage, and a 5,100-mAh battery that can last two full days on average. The camera is just OK, but this device will get two more Android OS upgrades and three more years of security updates, which is more than many of the devices below.Most PopularGearTesla's Cybercab Is HereByAarian MarshallGearThe World's First Commercial Space Station Looks Like a Luxury Hotel InsideByCarlton ReidGearWe Staged a Debate to Test the Bluetooth Earrings Kamala Harris Didn’t WearByVerity BurnsGearCapture Your Adventures With Our Favorite Action CamerasByScott GilbertsonMoto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivered reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate.Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £600:The new Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a midrange contender with a triple-lens camera, silky smooth screen, and lightning-fast wired and wireless charging in a compact waterproof body, but limited software updates and a lack of processing power let it down. Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans.Avoid These PhonesPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuYou should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier. They won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.Moto G 5G 2024 for $200:I wouldn't bother with this Moto G. The performance is just too sluggish and the cameras are noticeably worse than the Moto G Power 5G. Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500). If you want to spend as little as possible, then theGalaxy A35 5G ($400)is another alternative.Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options.Our Favorite Motorola FeaturesPhotograph: MotorolaMoto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Ready For. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only), or theReady For Assistantif you’re connecting an Android tablet. If you’re using a TV, it needsMiracast supportto connect wirelessly, but you can use a USB-C or HDMI cable as well. If someone askedwhat kind of pet you want, you’d probably say a cat or a dog. In this analogy, Motorola phones are hamsters. They're still cute and definitelypets, but not necessarily the first or second one that comes to mind. The company’s Android smartphones often play third (or fourth) fiddle to the likes of Samsung and Google.

There's still a crease on the screen where the device folds, but I didn't find it annoying. It's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser-performing processor compared to the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found on otherhigh-end Android devices. That said, performance was smooth for me, thanks to the 12 GB of RAM, even when playing games. You get other standard-fare accouterments like NFC for tap-to-pay via Google Wallet, wireless charging, and 256 GB of internal storage.This Razr+ exclusively uses Motorola's new Photo Enhancement Engine, which the company says uses artificial intelligence to produce better images. Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results.I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so.There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale.

Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.A Good Midrange MotorolaPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Edge (2024)$582at Amazon$550at Best Buy$550at MotorolaIf you're looking for a smartphone around the $500 mark, I'd first steer you toward theGoogle Pixel 8A.

It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up.

Indeed, these photos are some of the best you'll snap on any Motorola phone, but it's still playing catch up with much of the competition. Photos take quite a bit of time to process too, so you'll have to get used to that. It's not a perfect camera system, but I was generally happy with many of the results. I just wish Motorola didn't get rid of the ultrawide camera—it was easy to snap selfies with other people using the front screen as a preview on its predecessor, but now it's harder to fit more people in the frame with the default 50-MP main camera. The ultrawide was replaced by a 2X telephoto camera, and while I typically like zooming in, the zoom level doesn't impress and the quality is so-so. There's a 4,000-mAh battery on the Razr+ and it'll get you through a full day with average use, but heavy users most likely will need to top up before the day's end. That's just about the only main gripe I have with this phone. It's super fun and satisfying to use, looks great—especially in the newhot pink color—and runs pretty well with a solid camera system. My pro tip? Wait for a sale. There will likely be a decent discount in a few months; last year's Razr+ stayed at $700 for almost half its shelf life. Motorola promises three Android OS upgrades and four years of bimonthly security updates. ★ A Cheaper Fold Photograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at Motorola  Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Motorola Razr (2024)$700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at Motorola Motorola Razr (2024) Motorola Razr (2024) $700at Amazon$700at Best Buy$700at Motorola $700at Amazon $700at Amazon $700at Amazon $700 $700at Best Buy $700at Best Buy $700at Best Buy $700 $700at Motorola $700at Motorola $700at Motorola $700 This is the cheapest folding phone you can buy in the US, and you'll likely see it dip to $500 in a few months. Compared to the Razr+, the Razr (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has a slightly smaller front screen. You can't seeasmuch information at a glance but it's still plenty big enough to view some apps, notifications, and access widgets. Inside is a similar OLED 6.9-inch screen with up to a120-Hz refresh rate. It retains the ultrawide instead of the telephoto, and the camera system is overall solid—not horrible, not amazing. The 4,200-mAh batterydoeslast longer than the Razr+, though the device falls short in performance. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB of RAM, I just encountered more sluggish behavior that at times made it annoying to use.

Not your jam? Then Motorola's 2024 Edge is a pretty good alternative. It's slightly more expensive at $550, but you get a large 6.6-inch AMOLED screen with a144-Hz screen refresh rateand speedy performance thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset. It's not a flagship chipset but enough to deliver snappy app launches and lag-free gameplay. It has all the basics from NFC so you can pay with your phone via Google Wallet, plus anIP68 water resistance rating, ensuring it won't succumb to a drop in the pool. It supports wireless charging, comes with 256 GB of storage, and packs some pretty loud Dolby Atmos stereo speakers. I used it as my daily phone for two weeks and it performed remarkably well. The 5,000-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day with average use and often can go well into the second day before a top-up. Use the Edge heavily and it's firmly in the charge-once-a-day territory.

The Edge uses a so-called waterfall display, where the glass on the front curves into the edges for a more immersive look. It certainly looks fancy, but I've had several moments where my fingers holding the phone's edges disrupted an action I was trying to complete with my other hand. This has long been an issue on phones with curved screens. It's easy to get used to and adjust your grip quickly, but it's annoying.Second, the 50-MP main camera has a bit of shutter lag, which can be frustrating when you're trying to capture moving subjects (like my dog, who won't sit still). The pics you can get out of it are solid, perfectly acceptable images during the day. The contrast is a little too strong sometimes, and it doesn't handle high-contrast scenes all that great, but there's good detail. In low light, you'll encounter a few more blurry photos due to that shutter lag and shaky hands, but if the conditions are right, you can get some sharp, in-focus shots. This is where the Pixel 8A handily beats the Edge 2024.Unfortunately, Motorola promises only two Android OS upgrades (up to Android 16) and three years of security updates to the Edge 2024. The Pixel 8A will get seven years of software support and costs less. This is one of Motorola's biggest weaknesses, but if you plan on upgrading within three years or so, then it isn't a big deal.

It can take some decent pictures even in low light (make sure you use night mode), but in general, these photos aren't going to knock your socks off.The problem? While it has everything you need all at a low price, this phone will only get one Android OS update (to Android 15) later this year or early in 2025. It'll still get three years of security updates, so while that means the phone will stay patched and secure, you won't get new Android features past a year. There's also more bloatware on this device than ever before, but at least much of it is easy to uninstall or disable. It comes with 128 GB of internal storage, but you can upgrade that thanks to a microSD card slot.If you can get past those flaws, the Moto G Power 5G 2024 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $300, and better yet, it has already dipped as low as $282, so wait for a sale.Motorola promises one Android OS upgrade and three years of bimonthly security updates.If You Want a StylusPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMotorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2024)$400$349at Amazon$400at Best Buy$400at MotorolaThe Moto G Stylus doesn't feel drastically different from the Moto G Power.

Save your cash for one of the above picks.The CompetitionMotorola’s top competition comes from Google, Nothing, and Samsung. If you asked me what phone to buy, I’d point you to theGoogle Pixel 8A ($499). It has most of the features folks want in a smartphone—including wireless charging. TheNothing Phone 2a ($350)is also a worthy contender, as is the newCMF Phone 1 ($199)if it works on your network. If your budget can stretch, look at theSamsung Galaxy S23 FE ($600)orOnePlus 12R ($500). If you want to spend as little as possible, then theGalaxy A35 5G ($400)is another alternative.Read ourBest Cheap PhonesandBest Android Phone guidesfor more options.Our Favorite Motorola FeaturesPhotograph: MotorolaMoto Gestures:One of the first proper smartphones I bought was the Moto X, and that’s when (then Google-owned) Motorola debuted Moto Actions, which let you use physical gestures to trigger some features on the phone. They are still very much a part of a Motorola phone’s identity, even if they’re now called Moto Gestures. You can head to the Moto app on the phone to find all of them or go toSettings>Gestures. The ones I use most often are the double-chop gesture to trigger the flashlight and the double-twist action to launch the camera.Moto Connect:Formerly known as Ready For, this isn't available on thecheaper Motorola phones. It lets you wirelessly connect the phone to a nearby display, where you can see mobile apps, use your phone as a webcam, and share files. If your Moto is supported, you can find it by heading toSettings>Connected devices>Ready For. If you’re connecting it to a PC, you’ll need to download thedesktop client (Windows only), or theReady For Assistantif you’re connecting an Android tablet. If you’re using a TV, it needsMiracast supportto connect wirelessly, but you can use a USB-C or HDMI cable as well. Moto G Play 2024 for $150:It works on 4G LTE only and doesn't have NFC for contactless payments, not to mention it receives only one Android OS update. Still, thisMoto G Playdelivered reasonably decent performance for the money. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 feels quick, the 6.5-inch LCD is plenty bright, and there's even a 90-Hz screen refresh rate.  Motorola Edge 50 Pro for £600:The new Motorola Edge 50 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a midrange contender with a triple-lens camera, silky smooth screen, and lightning-fast wired and wireless charging in a compact waterproof body, but limited software updates and a lack of processing power let it down. Available globally (except in the US and Canada), it's worth a look for Motorola stans. Avoid These Phones Avoid These Phones   Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Photograph: Julian Chokkattu You should avoid buying any Moto G phone from 2023 or earlier. They won’t get any more Android version updates, and the prices aren’t drastically different from the latest models. The one I mention below is a 2024 model I didn’t like.

It's a watch! It's a Motorola concept at MWC 2024!Written byKerry Wan,Senior Reviews EditorFeb. 25, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. PTKerry Wan/ZDNETPregaming my week atMobile World Congresswith a demo of Motorola's bendable phone concept may have been the best worst decision of my life. On one hand, the coolness factor of a phone that can wrap around your wrist is beyond measure. On the other hand, it's so ambitious that you quickly realize how far-fetched it is when you finally put it on.Also:Best gadgets I saw at MWC 2024: Smart rings, concept phones, transparent laptopsMotorola first unveiled the bendable concept atLenovo Tech World last October, but I'd like to believe that Barcelona was where the company first took the phone out for in-person demos, because the whole experience sure felt like it, from the glitches and bugs to a fellow journalist doing an impromptu drop test because...magnets and the unpredictable forces that come with beta hardware.But during the moments when each of us in the roomcouldsnap the phone around our wrists, there was always a respectful nod of approval, followed by shutter sounds left and right. This thing rocks. And it's so geeky that I'm still thinking about it hours later.The concept phone begins as a 6.9-inch slab, treated with a bendable, woven-fabric material backplate. Look carefully and you'll see bits of the fabric starting to loosen and tangle out along the edges, but I'm sure even Motorola wasn't prepared for all the smartphone origami that was going to unfold that evening.Also:I tested 40 phones over the past year, and these are the very bestDepending on where you stand in the wrist-worn phone debate, the best part of the Motorola concept is either the fact that you can bend it to become its own kickstand or how it magnetically attaches to the accommodating wristband. Bend the phone like a rainbow and you can even get a two-player Connect Four session going.Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe band that helps the phone stay on the wrist reminded me of Milanese-style ones, like for the Apple Watch. You snap the band on firmly, align the magnetic pin with the back of the concept phone, and then bend the device until it covers all but one side of your arm. The attachment part of the process took several attempts across several journalists, and because the concept phone already had some weight to it, it felt more like a two-person job than one.Also:A smartphone without apps? This AI assistant aims to replace them allTo put it nicely, I was able to swipe around the phone like any other, cycling through app folders and a clock widget. But the bugs were strong with this one, and more often than not, the phone didn't register my taps and inputs.Kerry Wan/ZDNETOn the other hand, Motorola also had its""Moto-rolla"" conceptfrom last MWC on display, and I couldn't help but keep gravitating toward that. With a double press of a side key, the rollable display would be pulled from behind the device and onto the front, extending what looked to be a 5.8-inch screen into a 6.8-inch-like size. The software experience was much more refined compared to the bendable, and playing a YouTube video automatically triggered the rollable sequence.All that is to say I've officially tried both of Motorola's latest concept phones, and if I had to put stock into one of them, I'd choose the rollable over the bendable. Maybe next year, the bendable will outshine Motorola's 2025 concept device. We'll just have to wait and see.Featured reviews3 features in Apple's new AirPods 4 that made me ditch my AirPods ProsWhy I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone)The Windows laptop I recommend to most people undercuts the MacBook Air (but is just as capable)One of the best pool-cleaning robots I've tested proved its worth in the most extreme conditions3 features in Apple's new AirPods 4 that made me ditch my AirPods ProsWhy I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone)The Windows laptop I recommend to most people undercuts the MacBook Air (but is just as capable)One of the best pool-cleaning robots I've tested proved its worth in the most extreme conditionsEditorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity GuidelinesRelatedOne of the best Android smartwatches I've tested made me consider switching to the PixelThe best Android smartwatches you can buy: Expert testedThe best smartwatches you can buy: Expert testedZDNETwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.TopicsGalleriesVideosDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Informationabout ZDNETMeet The TeamSitemapReprint PolicyJoin|Log InNewslettersSite AssistanceLicensing© 2024 ZDNET, A Ziff Davis company.

It's a Motorola concept at MWC 2024!Written byKerry Wan,Senior Reviews EditorFeb. 25, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. PTKerry Wan/ZDNETPregaming my week atMobile World Congresswith a demo of Motorola's bendable phone concept may have been the best worst decision of my life. On one hand, the coolness factor of a phone that can wrap around your wrist is beyond measure. On the other hand, it's so ambitious that you quickly realize how far-fetched it is when you finally put it on.Also:Best gadgets I saw at MWC 2024: Smart rings, concept phones, transparent laptopsMotorola first unveiled the bendable concept atLenovo Tech World last October, but I'd like to believe that Barcelona was where the company first took the phone out for in-person demos, because the whole experience sure felt like it, from the glitches and bugs to a fellow journalist doing an impromptu drop test because...magnets and the unpredictable forces that come with beta hardware.But during the moments when each of us in the roomcouldsnap the phone around our wrists, there was always a respectful nod of approval, followed by shutter sounds left and right. This thing rocks. And it's so geeky that I'm still thinking about it hours later.The concept phone begins as a 6.9-inch slab, treated with a bendable, woven-fabric material backplate. Look carefully and you'll see bits of the fabric starting to loosen and tangle out along the edges, but I'm sure even Motorola wasn't prepared for all the smartphone origami that was going to unfold that evening.Also:I tested 40 phones over the past year, and these are the very bestDepending on where you stand in the wrist-worn phone debate, the best part of the Motorola concept is either the fact that you can bend it to become its own kickstand or how it magnetically attaches to the accommodating wristband. Bend the phone like a rainbow and you can even get a two-player Connect Four session going.Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe band that helps the phone stay on the wrist reminded me of Milanese-style ones, like for the Apple Watch. You snap the band on firmly, align the magnetic pin with the back of the concept phone, and then bend the device until it covers all but one side of your arm. The attachment part of the process took several attempts across several journalists, and because the concept phone already had some weight to it, it felt more like a two-person job than one.Also:A smartphone without apps? This AI assistant aims to replace them allTo put it nicely, I was able to swipe around the phone like any other, cycling through app folders and a clock widget. But the bugs were strong with this one, and more often than not, the phone didn't register my taps and inputs.Kerry Wan/ZDNETOn the other hand, Motorola also had its""Moto-rolla"" conceptfrom last MWC on display, and I couldn't help but keep gravitating toward that. With a double press of a side key, the rollable display would be pulled from behind the device and onto the front, extending what looked to be a 5.8-inch screen into a 6.8-inch-like size. The software experience was much more refined compared to the bendable, and playing a YouTube video automatically triggered the rollable sequence.All that is to say I've officially tried both of Motorola's latest concept phones, and if I had to put stock into one of them, I'd choose the rollable over the bendable. Maybe next year, the bendable will outshine Motorola's 2025 concept device. We'll just have to wait and see.Featured reviews3 features in Apple's new AirPods 4 that made me ditch my AirPods ProsWhy I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone)The Windows laptop I recommend to most people undercuts the MacBook Air (but is just as capable)One of the best pool-cleaning robots I've tested proved its worth in the most extreme conditions3 features in Apple's new AirPods 4 that made me ditch my AirPods ProsWhy I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone)The Windows laptop I recommend to most people undercuts the MacBook Air (but is just as capable)One of the best pool-cleaning robots I've tested proved its worth in the most extreme conditionsEditorial standardsShow CommentsLog In to CommentCommunity GuidelinesRelatedOne of the best Android smartwatches I've tested made me consider switching to the PixelThe best Android smartwatches you can buy: Expert testedThe best smartwatches you can buy: Expert testedZDNETwe equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.TopicsGalleriesVideosDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Informationabout ZDNETMeet The TeamSitemapReprint PolicyJoin|Log InNewslettersSite AssistanceLicensing© 2024 ZDNET, A Ziff Davis company.

NewslettersVideosEditorial Guidelines Newsletters Newsletters Newsletters Videos Videos Videos Editorial Guidelines Editorial Guidelines Editorial Guidelines TechHomeTechSmartphonesI wore Motorola's bendable smartphone-watch hybrid, and it left me all kinds of confusedIt's a phone! It's a watch! It's a Motorola concept at MWC 2024!Written byKerry Wan,Senior Reviews EditorFeb. 25, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. PTKerry Wan/ZDNETPregaming my week atMobile World Congresswith a demo of Motorola's bendable phone concept may have been the best worst decision of my life. On one hand, the coolness factor of a phone that can wrap around your wrist is beyond measure. On the other hand, it's so ambitious that you quickly realize how far-fetched it is when you finally put it on.Also:Best gadgets I saw at MWC 2024: Smart rings, concept phones, transparent laptopsMotorola first unveiled the bendable concept atLenovo Tech World last October, but I'd like to believe that Barcelona was where the company first took the phone out for in-person demos, because the whole experience sure felt like it, from the glitches and bugs to a fellow journalist doing an impromptu drop test because...magnets and the unpredictable forces that come with beta hardware.But during the moments when each of us in the roomcouldsnap the phone around our wrists, there was always a respectful nod of approval, followed by shutter sounds left and right. This thing rocks. And it's so geeky that I'm still thinking about it hours later.The concept phone begins as a 6.9-inch slab, treated with a bendable, woven-fabric material backplate. Look carefully and you'll see bits of the fabric starting to loosen and tangle out along the edges, but I'm sure even Motorola wasn't prepared for all the smartphone origami that was going to unfold that evening.Also:I tested 40 phones over the past year, and these are the very bestDepending on where you stand in the wrist-worn phone debate, the best part of the Motorola concept is either the fact that you can bend it to become its own kickstand or how it magnetically attaches to the accommodating wristband. Bend the phone like a rainbow and you can even get a two-player Connect Four session going.Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe band that helps the phone stay on the wrist reminded me of Milanese-style ones, like for the Apple Watch. You snap the band on firmly, align the magnetic pin with the back of the concept phone, and then bend the device until it covers all but one side of your arm. The attachment part of the process took several attempts across several journalists, and because the concept phone already had some weight to it, it felt more like a two-person job than one.Also:A smartphone without apps? This AI assistant aims to replace them allTo put it nicely, I was able to swipe around the phone like any other, cycling through app folders and a clock widget. But the bugs were strong with this one, and more often than not, the phone didn't register my taps and inputs.Kerry Wan/ZDNETOn the other hand, Motorola also had its""Moto-rolla"" conceptfrom last MWC on display, and I couldn't help but keep gravitating toward that. With a double press of a side key, the rollable display would be pulled from behind the device and onto the front, extending what looked to be a 5.8-inch screen into a 6.8-inch-like size.

On one hand, the coolness factor of a phone that can wrap around your wrist is beyond measure. On the other hand, it's so ambitious that you quickly realize how far-fetched it is when you finally put it on.Also:Best gadgets I saw at MWC 2024: Smart rings, concept phones, transparent laptopsMotorola first unveiled the bendable concept atLenovo Tech World last October, but I'd like to believe that Barcelona was where the company first took the phone out for in-person demos, because the whole experience sure felt like it, from the glitches and bugs to a fellow journalist doing an impromptu drop test because...magnets and the unpredictable forces that come with beta hardware.But during the moments when each of us in the roomcouldsnap the phone around our wrists, there was always a respectful nod of approval, followed by shutter sounds left and right. This thing rocks. And it's so geeky that I'm still thinking about it hours later.The concept phone begins as a 6.9-inch slab, treated with a bendable, woven-fabric material backplate. Look carefully and you'll see bits of the fabric starting to loosen and tangle out along the edges, but I'm sure even Motorola wasn't prepared for all the smartphone origami that was going to unfold that evening.Also:I tested 40 phones over the past year, and these are the very bestDepending on where you stand in the wrist-worn phone debate, the best part of the Motorola concept is either the fact that you can bend it to become its own kickstand or how it magnetically attaches to the accommodating wristband. Bend the phone like a rainbow and you can even get a two-player Connect Four session going.Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe band that helps the phone stay on the wrist reminded me of Milanese-style ones, like for the Apple Watch. You snap the band on firmly, align the magnetic pin with the back of the concept phone, and then bend the device until it covers all but one side of your arm. The attachment part of the process took several attempts across several journalists, and because the concept phone already had some weight to it, it felt more like a two-person job than one.Also:A smartphone without apps? This AI assistant aims to replace them allTo put it nicely, I was able to swipe around the phone like any other, cycling through app folders and a clock widget. But the bugs were strong with this one, and more often than not, the phone didn't register my taps and inputs.Kerry Wan/ZDNETOn the other hand, Motorola also had its""Moto-rolla"" conceptfrom last MWC on display, and I couldn't help but keep gravitating toward that. With a double press of a side key, the rollable display would be pulled from behind the device and onto the front, extending what looked to be a 5.8-inch screen into a 6.8-inch-like size.

Look carefully and you'll see bits of the fabric starting to loosen and tangle out along the edges, but I'm sure even Motorola wasn't prepared for all the smartphone origami that was going to unfold that evening.  Also:I tested 40 phones over the past year, and these are the very best Depending on where you stand in the wrist-worn phone debate, the best part of the Motorola concept is either the fact that you can bend it to become its own kickstand or how it magnetically attaches to the accommodating wristband. Bend the phone like a rainbow and you can even get a two-player Connect Four session going.       Kerry Wan/ZDNET The band that helps the phone stay on the wrist reminded me of Milanese-style ones, like for the Apple Watch. You snap the band on firmly, align the magnetic pin with the back of the concept phone, and then bend the device until it covers all but one side of your arm. The attachment part of the process took several attempts across several journalists, and because the concept phone already had some weight to it, it felt more like a two-person job than one.  Also:A smartphone without apps? This AI assistant aims to replace them all To put it nicely, I was able to swipe around the phone like any other, cycling through app folders and a clock widget. But the bugs were strong with this one, and more often than not, the phone didn't register my taps and inputs.      Kerry Wan/ZDNET On the other hand, Motorola also had its""Moto-rolla"" conceptfrom last MWC on display, and I couldn't help but keep gravitating toward that. With a double press of a side key, the rollable display would be pulled from behind the device and onto the front, extending what looked to be a 5.8-inch screen into a 6.8-inch-like size. The software experience was much more refined compared to the bendable, and playing a YouTube video automatically triggered the rollable sequence.   All that is to say I've officially tried both of Motorola's latest concept phones, and if I had to put stock into one of them, I'd choose the rollable over the bendable. Maybe next year, the bendable will outshine Motorola's 2025 concept device. We'll just have to wait and see.

Front and center, you can't miss the gorgeous 6.7-inch OLED display with a blazing-fast 165Hz refresh rate. It's powered by a last gen Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 paired with 8GB RAM that still offers impressive performance. It's powered by a large 5,100mAh battery with support for 68W charging with a charger included in the box.Our Motorola Edge+ reviewfound the camera system to be impressive with nice images coming from the main 50MP camera, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 12MP 2x telephoto camera. Water and dust resistance with an IP68 rating is also nice to have and the modern chipset enables strong Wi-Fi 7 and 5G support. Launching with Android 3 with three OS updates promised, this is a nice high-end return to form for Motorola.Best stylus phone(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)2.

Thanks to its gorgeous vegan leather back panel, this smartphone looks and feels far more premium than what its affordable price tag might have you believe. Under the hood, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC paired with 8GB of RAM, so everyday tasks like web browsing and even casual gaming work with little to no issues. There's also 256GB of internal storage, as well as an expansion slot that can take up microSD cards of up to 1TB in size.As the name suggests, the biggest standout feature of theMoto G Stylus 5G 2024is its integrated stylus, which lets you doodle, jot down notes, and do a lot more with ease. It works perfectly with the smartphone's 6.7-inch pOLED screen, which comes with a resolution of 1080x2400 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. You get all standard connectivity and I/O features including dual-band Wi-Fi, a 3.5mm audio port, and even NFC for contactless payments. The whole package is backed by a 5,000mAh battery with fast wired (30W) and wireless (15W) charging support.Best value(Image credit: Motorola)3.

The display sits beneath a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 giving it protection from minor drops. It even has a fingerprint reader on the side making it quick to unlock your phone without sacrificing security. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which isn’t great for 3D gaming, but is reasonably fast for basic messaging apps, social media, video calling, and taking photos.Charging is relatively slow at just 15W, but with a large 5,000mAh battery, if you top it up overnight, it should easily last all day and then some. The rear camera has a 50MP sensor that can take decent enough photos in enough light, but won’t blow you away. At this price, however, you’re still getting solid results that are more than sufficient for sharing with your friends. Keep in mind that this phone doesn’t support 5G, so you’ll be stuck with the LTE coverage on your carrier, but generally, LTE offers plenty of speed for most people.Best foldable(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)4.

It sports a stunning vegan leather back panel and is available in four funky color options. Up front, you get a bigger 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED screen that not only comes with a 165Hz refresh rate but can now easily run full-screen apps as well, making it more functional than ever.Flip open the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and you'll be greeted with a 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED panel that also has a 165Hz refresh rate. Driven by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC, the smartphone features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, which means it should effortlessly handle everything from multitasking to some gaming. You get Android 14 out of the box, and the software experience is further enhanced by thoughtful additions from Motorola, going a long way in making this arguably thebest flip phonecurrently available out there.Talking about cameras, there's a dual-lens primary setup with a 50MP wide-angle sensor and a 50MP telephoto module (with 2x optical zoom). As Android Central's Derrek Lee noted inhis review, the system is capable of producing extremely good quality images, and the camcorder mode is plain fun to use. The smartphone packs all modern I/O and connectivity options, and is backed by a 4,000mAh battery with both wired and wireless charging support.Best for productivity(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)5.

This is a phone targeted at business users, and its PC integration allows you to use it as a webcam, instantly enable hotspot data, and even stream apps to your PC. Even if you’re not interested in those computer tie-ins, you still get a sleek phone with plenty of grip on the housing. Battery life is strong from the 5,000mAh battery and 68W charging with an included charge.The phone is powered by the still fast Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 SoC with either 8GB or 12GB of storage. The display is a 6.6-inch OLED panel with a 144Hz refresh rate under a sheet of Gorilla Glass Victus. Naturally, 5G is supported with fast 6GHz Wi-Fi 6E also included.Our ThinkPhone reviewalso notes that this phone will receive Android updates through Android 16 with security updates through 2027. If you’re looking for a phone to help streamline your workflow with years of support, the ThinkPhone could be what you’ve been waiting for.Best battery life(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)6.

This phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 SoC with eight cores and 8GB of RAM. This allows it to offer good multitasking performance, but it will still struggle with demanding games. You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box.The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers. Overall, this is a strong pick for a mid-range device with sub-6 5G support on most carriers.Best value foldable(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)7. Motorola Razr (2023)Best value foldableOur expert review:SpecificationsDisplay:6.9-inch pOLED, 144Hz, 1080x2640 pixels resolution | 1.5-inch OLED, 60Hz, 194x368 pixels resolutionChipset / SoCC:Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1RAM:8GBStorage:128GBCameras:Rear: 64MP + 13MP, Front: 32MPOS:Android 13 (preloaded)Battery & Charging:4,200mAh, 30W (wired) & 5W (wireless) chargingToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Affordable for a folding phone+Excellent 144Hz OLED display+Great battery lifeReasons to avoid-Camera quality could be better-Only 128GB of storage-Small cover screenFolding phones have typically been prohibitively expensive with overkill hardware and over-the-top designs. TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8. Moto G 5G (2024)Best budget battery lifeOur expert review:SpecificationsDisplay:6.6-inch IPS LCD, 120Hz, 720x1612 pixels resolutionChipset / SoC:Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 1RAM:4GBStorage:128GB, with microSD card expansionCameras:Rear: 50MP + 2MP, Front: 8MPOS:Android 14 (preloaded)Battery & Charging:5,000mAh, 18W (wired) chargingToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Nice vegan leather back+All-day battery life+NFC and a 3.5mm headphone jack inlcudedReasons to avoid-Performance can be sluggish-Display doesn't get very bright-Cameras aren't greatTheMoto G 5G (2024)doesn't do anything special, besides being a generally good smartphone for under $200. This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there.Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices.How to pick the right Motorola phone for youIf you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier.The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&TBe an expert in 5 minutesGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Patrick FarmerSocial Links NavigationeCommerce EditorAfter almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

Under the hood, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC paired with 8GB of RAM, so everyday tasks like web browsing and even casual gaming work with little to no issues. There's also 256GB of internal storage, as well as an expansion slot that can take up microSD cards of up to 1TB in size.As the name suggests, the biggest standout feature of theMoto G Stylus 5G 2024is its integrated stylus, which lets you doodle, jot down notes, and do a lot more with ease.

It even has a fingerprint reader on the side making it quick to unlock your phone without sacrificing security. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which isn’t great for 3D gaming, but is reasonably fast for basic messaging apps, social media, video calling, and taking photos.Charging is relatively slow at just 15W, but with a large 5,000mAh battery, if you top it up overnight, it should easily last all day and then some. The rear camera has a 50MP sensor that can take decent enough photos in enough light, but won’t blow you away. At this price, however, you’re still getting solid results that are more than sufficient for sharing with your friends.

Up front, you get a bigger 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED screen that not only comes with a 165Hz refresh rate but can now easily run full-screen apps as well, making it more functional than ever.Flip open the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and you'll be greeted with a 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED panel that also has a 165Hz refresh rate.

You get Android 14 out of the box, and the software experience is further enhanced by thoughtful additions from Motorola, going a long way in making this arguably thebest flip phonecurrently available out there.Talking about cameras, there's a dual-lens primary setup with a 50MP wide-angle sensor and a 50MP telephoto module (with 2x optical zoom). As Android Central's Derrek Lee noted inhis review, the system is capable of producing extremely good quality images, and the camcorder mode is plain fun to use.

Even if you’re not interested in those computer tie-ins, you still get a sleek phone with plenty of grip on the housing.

This phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 SoC with eight cores and 8GB of RAM. This allows it to offer good multitasking performance, but it will still struggle with demanding games. You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box.The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers. Overall, this is a strong pick for a mid-range device with sub-6 5G support on most carriers.Best value foldable(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)7.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there.Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices.How to pick the right Motorola phone for youIf you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier.The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&TBe an expert in 5 minutesGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Patrick FarmerSocial Links NavigationeCommerce EditorAfter almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there.Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices.How to pick the right Motorola phone for youIf you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier.The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&TBe an expert in 5 minutesGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Patrick FarmerSocial Links NavigationeCommerce EditorAfter almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there.Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices.How to pick the right Motorola phone for youIf you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier.The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&TBe an expert in 5 minutesGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Patrick FarmerSocial Links NavigationeCommerce EditorAfter almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

It's powered by a last gen Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 paired with 8GB RAM that still offers impressive performance. It's powered by a large 5,100mAh battery with support for 68W charging with a charger included in the box.Our Motorola Edge+ reviewfound the camera system to be impressive with nice images coming from the main 50MP camera, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 12MP 2x telephoto camera. Water and dust resistance with an IP68 rating is also nice to have and the modern chipset enables strong Wi-Fi 7 and 5G support.

Under the hood, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC paired with 8GB of RAM, so everyday tasks like web browsing and even casual gaming work with little to no issues.

The display sits beneath a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 giving it protection from minor drops. It even has a fingerprint reader on the side making it quick to unlock your phone without sacrificing security. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which isn’t great for 3D gaming, but is reasonably fast for basic messaging apps, social media, video calling, and taking photos.Charging is relatively slow at just 15W, but with a large 5,000mAh battery, if you top it up overnight, it should easily last all day and then some. The rear camera has a 50MP sensor that can take decent enough photos in enough light, but won’t blow you away. At this price, however, you’re still getting solid results that are more than sufficient for sharing with your friends. Keep in mind that this phone doesn’t support 5G, so you’ll be stuck with the LTE coverage on your carrier, but generally, LTE offers plenty of speed for most people.Best foldable(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)4.

You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box.The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers.

The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&TBe an expert in 5 minutesGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Patrick FarmerSocial Links NavigationeCommerce EditorAfter almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

Front and center, you can't miss the gorgeous 6.7-inch OLED display with a blazing-fast 165Hz refresh rate. It's powered by a last gen Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 paired with 8GB RAM that still offers impressive performance. It's powered by a large 5,100mAh battery with support for 68W charging with a charger included in the box.Our Motorola Edge+ reviewfound the camera system to be impressive with nice images coming from the main 50MP camera, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 12MP 2x telephoto camera. Water and dust resistance with an IP68 rating is also nice to have and the modern chipset enables strong Wi-Fi 7 and 5G support.

Thanks to its gorgeous vegan leather back panel, this smartphone looks and feels far more premium than what its affordable price tag might have you believe. Under the hood, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC paired with 8GB of RAM, so everyday tasks like web browsing and even casual gaming work with little to no issues. There's also 256GB of internal storage, as well as an expansion slot that can take up microSD cards of up to 1TB in size.As the name suggests, the biggest standout feature of theMoto G Stylus 5G 2024is its integrated stylus, which lets you doodle, jot down notes, and do a lot more with ease. It works perfectly with the smartphone's 6.7-inch pOLED screen, which comes with a resolution of 1080x2400 pixels and a 120Hz refresh rate. You get all standard connectivity and I/O features including dual-band Wi-Fi, a 3.5mm audio port, and even NFC for contactless payments.

The display sits beneath a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 giving it protection from minor drops. It even has a fingerprint reader on the side making it quick to unlock your phone without sacrificing security. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which isn’t great for 3D gaming, but is reasonably fast for basic messaging apps, social media, video calling, and taking photos.Charging is relatively slow at just 15W, but with a large 5,000mAh battery, if you top it up overnight, it should easily last all day and then some. The rear camera has a 50MP sensor that can take decent enough photos in enough light, but won’t blow you away. At this price, however, you’re still getting solid results that are more than sufficient for sharing with your friends. Keep in mind that this phone doesn’t support 5G, so you’ll be stuck with the LTE coverage on your carrier, but generally, LTE offers plenty of speed for most people.Best foldable(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)4.

You get Android 14 out of the box, and the software experience is further enhanced by thoughtful additions from Motorola, going a long way in making this arguably thebest flip phonecurrently available out there.Talking about cameras, there's a dual-lens primary setup with a 50MP wide-angle sensor and a 50MP telephoto module (with 2x optical zoom). As Android Central's Derrek Lee noted inhis review, the system is capable of producing extremely good quality images, and the camcorder mode is plain fun to use.

This phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 SoC with eight cores and 8GB of RAM. This allows it to offer good multitasking performance, but it will still struggle with demanding games. You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box.The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023).

The display sits beneath a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 giving it protection from minor drops. It even has a fingerprint reader on the side making it quick to unlock your phone without sacrificing security. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which isn’t great for 3D gaming, but is reasonably fast for basic messaging apps, social media, video calling, and taking photos.Charging is relatively slow at just 15W, but with a large 5,000mAh battery, if you top it up overnight, it should easily last all day and then some. The rear camera has a 50MP sensor that can take decent enough photos in enough light, but won’t blow you away. At this price, however, you’re still getting solid results that are more than sufficient for sharing with your friends.

As Android Central's Derrek Lee noted inhis review, the system is capable of producing extremely good quality images, and the camcorder mode is plain fun to use.

This phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 SoC with eight cores and 8GB of RAM. This allows it to offer good multitasking performance, but it will still struggle with demanding games. You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box.The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there.Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices.How to pick the right Motorola phone for youIf you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier.The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&TBe an expert in 5 minutesGet the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of AndroidContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Patrick FarmerSocial Links NavigationeCommerce EditorAfter almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023.

It sports a stunning vegan leather back panel and is available in four funky color options. Up front, you get a bigger 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED screen that not only comes with a 165Hz refresh rate but can now easily run full-screen apps as well, making it more functional than ever.Flip open the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and you'll be greeted with a 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED panel that also has a 165Hz refresh rate. Driven by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC, the smartphone features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, which means it should effortlessly handle everything from multitasking to some gaming. You get Android 14 out of the box, and the software experience is further enhanced by thoughtful additions from Motorola, going a long way in making this arguably thebest flip phonecurrently available out there.Talking about cameras, there's a dual-lens primary setup with a 50MP wide-angle sensor and a 50MP telephoto module (with 2x optical zoom). As Android Central's Derrek Lee noted inhis review, the system is capable of producing extremely good quality images, and the camcorder mode is plain fun to use. The smartphone packs all modern I/O and connectivity options, and is backed by a 4,000mAh battery with both wired and wireless charging support.Best for productivity(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)5.

This is a phone targeted at business users, and its PC integration allows you to use it as a webcam, instantly enable hotspot data, and even stream apps to your PC. Even if you’re not interested in those computer tie-ins, you still get a sleek phone with plenty of grip on the housing. Battery life is strong from the 5,000mAh battery and 68W charging with an included charge.The phone is powered by the still fast Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 SoC with either 8GB or 12GB of storage. The display is a 6.6-inch OLED panel with a 144Hz refresh rate under a sheet of Gorilla Glass Victus. Naturally, 5G is supported with fast 6GHz Wi-Fi 6E also included.Our ThinkPhone reviewalso notes that this phone will receive Android updates through Android 16 with security updates through 2027.

This phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 SoC with eight cores and 8GB of RAM. This allows it to offer good multitasking performance, but it will still struggle with demanding games. You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box.The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers. Overall, this is a strong pick for a mid-range device with sub-6 5G support on most carriers.Best value foldable(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)7.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage.Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.Best budget battery life(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)8.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15.The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.Back to the top ^How to chooseWhy the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) is our top pickWhy you can trust Android CentralOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there.Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices.How to pick the right Motorola phone for youIf you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier.The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen.The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung.Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone.The runner-up includes a stylus(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones.The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC?If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.Phone deals:Best Buy|Walmart|Samsung|Amazon|Verizon|AT&T Quick Menu(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)At a glance1.Best overall2.Best stylus phone3.Best value4.Best foldable5.Best for productivity6.Best battery life7.Best value foldable8.Best budget battery lifeHow to choose Quick Menu (Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)At a glance1.Best overall2.Best stylus phone3.Best value4.Best foldable5.Best for productivity6.Best battery life7.Best value foldable8.Best budget battery lifeHow to choose    (Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central) At a glance1.Best overall2.Best stylus phone3.Best value4.Best foldable5.Best for productivity6.Best battery life7.Best value foldable8.Best budget battery lifeHow to choose The best Motorola phones aim to give you great bang for the buck(s) with more than decent hardware on the low end, and some of the finest value when it comes to the high-end foldables.

Front and center, you can't miss the gorgeous 6.7-inch OLED display with a blazing-fast 165Hz refresh rate. It's powered by a last gen Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 paired with 8GB RAM that still offers impressive performance. It's powered by a large 5,100mAh battery with support for 68W charging with a charger included in the box. Our Motorola Edge+ reviewfound the camera system to be impressive with nice images coming from the main 50MP camera, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 12MP 2x telephoto camera. Water and dust resistance with an IP68 rating is also nice to have and the modern chipset enables strong Wi-Fi 7 and 5G support. Launching with Android 3 with three OS updates promised, this is a nice high-end return to form for Motorola. Best stylus phone Best stylus phone    (Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central) 2.

The display sits beneath a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 giving it protection from minor drops. It even has a fingerprint reader on the side making it quick to unlock your phone without sacrificing security. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 680 SoC with 4GB of RAM, which isn’t great for 3D gaming, but is reasonably fast for basic messaging apps, social media, video calling, and taking photos. Charging is relatively slow at just 15W, but with a large 5,000mAh battery, if you top it up overnight, it should easily last all day and then some. The rear camera has a 50MP sensor that can take decent enough photos in enough light, but won’t blow you away. At this price, however, you’re still getting solid results that are more than sufficient for sharing with your friends. Keep in mind that this phone doesn’t support 5G, so you’ll be stuck with the LTE coverage on your carrier, but generally, LTE offers plenty of speed for most people.

It sports a stunning vegan leather back panel and is available in four funky color options. Up front, you get a bigger 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED screen that not only comes with a 165Hz refresh rate but can now easily run full-screen apps as well, making it more functional than ever. Flip open the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and you'll be greeted with a 6.9-inch LTPO pOLED panel that also has a 165Hz refresh rate. Driven by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 SoC, the smartphone features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, which means it should effortlessly handle everything from multitasking to some gaming. You get Android 14 out of the box, and the software experience is further enhanced by thoughtful additions from Motorola, going a long way in making this arguably thebest flip phonecurrently available out there. Talking about cameras, there's a dual-lens primary setup with a 50MP wide-angle sensor and a 50MP telephoto module (with 2x optical zoom). As Android Central's Derrek Lee noted inhis review, the system is capable of producing extremely good quality images, and the camcorder mode is plain fun to use.

The display is a 6.6-inch OLED panel with a 144Hz refresh rate under a sheet of Gorilla Glass Victus.

This phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020 SoC with eight cores and 8GB of RAM. This allows it to offer good multitasking performance, but it will still struggle with demanding games. You're also on the latest version of Android with Android 14 installed out of the box. The 5,000mAh battery isn't that impressive on its own, but with 30W wired charging supported and even 15W wireless charging, this phone gives you a lot of flexibility on how and when you use that battery. Unfortunately, a 30W charger isn't included in the box, so if you want full charging speeds, you'll want to pick up one of thebest USB-C chargers. Overall, this is a strong pick for a mid-range device with sub-6 5G support on most carriers. Best value foldable Best value foldable    (Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central) 7.

TheMotorola Razr (2023)takes a step back, offering a sleek clamshell folding form factor with a large 6.9-inch internal display, and even though it's now been succeeded by a newer model, remains an excellent value. The smartphone packs a very good Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chipset and a small outer display, but still has plenty of performance for most users. The cover screen's a 1.5-inch panel that can display essential notifications, thus making the smartphone ideal for those who want to reduce their screen usage. Even with some hardware cutbacks, Motorola has made sure not to cut corners on the most important elements, like using tough Gorilla Glass Victus and packing in a large 4,200mAh battery. While it’s far from the best camera we’ve used, the Razr’s 64MP main camera takes decent images, especially considering the price. There’s also a 13MP ultrawide camera to help capture more in a tight space. Like its other folding phone, Motorola has promised three OS updates and four years of security updates on this model.

This phone has a reasonably large screen at 6.6 inches with a 120Hz refresh rate, though the resolution is a conservative 720x1612 pixels. Still, it more than gets the job done and is one of the reasons for this phone's battery endurance. Another reason is the Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC under the hood with 4GB of RAM. While this chipset will lag, our review found it to be a better performer than Samsung's competing Galaxy A15. The biggest reason for this phone's strong battery life is the large 5,000mAh battery with 18W wired charging. Wireless charging is absent from this phone, but that isn't surprising at this price. When it comes to software, the phone launched with Android 14 with Motorola promising an update to Android 15 at some point. With 5G support for the three major carrier, just about anyone can use it with their phone plan.

(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central) Motorola is great at striking a balance between performance and price, and this shows with theMotorola Edge Plus (2023). The device is powered by the critically acclaimed Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, the same processor found in some of the most powerful flagships on the market. Despite being a year old at this point, the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) continues to pack enough power to against some of the best Android phones available out there. Not only can you manage multiple days on a single charge, but the phone also offers a slick 165Hz OLED display and a speedy fingerprint sensor. The best part is that with this smartphone, Motorola is committing to three major OS upgrades and four years of updates, something that the company doesn't always offer with its devices. How to pick the right Motorola phone for you If you're looking at Motorola's phone lineup, especially the Moto G phones, it can be hard to tell them apart. Motorola's phones are split into three main categories with premium devices like the Moto Edge+ and ThinkPhone, then the Razr folding phones, followed by the budget-oriented Moto G series. While the Moto Edge+ and Thinkphone are good phones, if you're shopping for something high-end, you might find some of the otherbest Android phonesto be a better value, especially if you're getting it from a carrier. The Razr series is known for its striking designs and relatively affordable prices. The Motorola Razr 2023, for example, is still one of the cheapest folding phones you can get. Keep in mind, that while flip phones of the past were known for durability, the same can't be said for folding flip phones like the Razr. The internal screen is large and surprisingly high-quality but is soft and easily scratched, so it's more at home in an office than the job site. Folding phones can also be more difficult, and much more expensive, to repair if you do damage that screen. The Moto G series is updated every year like clockwork with the date following the name. Make sure you're picking the latest model available because, while Motorola has promised updates for most of its phones, it's so far been slow to deliver, and doesn't match up to the multiple OS updates offered by Google and Samsung. Make sure your Moto G phone has the hardware features you need, like NFC for payments, or fast charging as these specs can vary. If you need fast charging, the Moto G Power supports up to 30W, while others, especially 2023 models, can be significantly slower. While these phones can take some competent photos in decent lighting, if you're a prolific phone photographer, you'll be happy you spent a bit more on a higher-end Moto or even something like a Pixel A series phone. The runner-up includes a stylus    (Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central) Out of all the Motorola phones currently available, theMoto G Stylus 5G (2024)is a great pick for those looking for precision input. It has solid specs, features, and price are darn-near perfect given how affordable and good-looking the phone is, making it a clear winner in our eyes, particularly among otherbudget Android phones. The sleek, elegant design paired with a built-in stylus and useful gestures proves you don't need to spend a lot to get the premium Motorola experience. You also get Android 14 straight out of the box, alongside a big 5,000mAh battery and the very capable Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC. Did we mention that it also has a headphone jack and even goodies like wireless charging and NFC? If you're looking for the best overall Motorola phone, the Motorola Edge+ still stands out with its powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, fast 68W charging, and solid camera system. The phone is even set to get three OS updates with four years of security updates. If you were looking for a flagship phone from Motorola, the Edge+ is your best bet.

Recently, it's been on something of a streak too, with a run of well-designed, well-specced devices, that have impressed us in reviews.The brand also everything from classic candy bar smartphones to clamshells that we think are some of thebest foldable phonesyou can buy. So, whatever handheld you're looking for, you'll likely find one to suit your needs amidst its line-up.We've extensively tested and reviewed quite a few Motorola handsets by way of a full review. This means we've tested and lived with them for a period of a few weeks in order to bring you as honest and realistic a breakdown of the experience offered up by each phone as possible. And to help you along, we've listed all the best Motorola phones below. They're ranked according to our preference, but don't be afraid to choose one of the lower-ranked options, as they'll still be excellent for some people.If none on this list catches your eye, don't worry. We're constantly updating this guide and make sure to add any new models that are worthy of a spot on the list (and removing old models which have seen better days). Though, if you've decided that a Motorola phone still isn't for you, you should take a look at ourbest Android phonesorbest iPhonesguides as well.The best Motorola phones 2024Why you can trust TechRadarWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)1. Motorola Edge 40 ProThe best Motorola phone you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:April 2023Weight:199gDimensions:161.2 x 74 x 8.6 mmOS:Android 13Screen size:6.67-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Snapdragon 8 Gen 2RAM:12GBStorage:256GB/512GBBattery:4,600mAh/5,000mAhRear camera:50MP + 12MP + 50MPFront camera:60MPToday's Best DealsView at AmazonReasons to buy+Slim, light, and comfortable design+Vibrant, bright screen+Super-fast charging and long battery lifeReasons to avoid-Android updates not guaranteed-Underwhelming camera, despite specs-Annoying bloatware on setupThe Motorola Edge 40 Pro is the absolute best Motorola smartphone released so far. The company manages to keep pace with all the latest specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, large amounts of RAM and storage, and a super bright screen paired with a high refresh rate.After reviewing it, we feel it's the closest thing you'll get to a Pixel-like experience without buying one ofGoogle's Pixel handsets. It could even be better when one considers the advantages Qualcomm's chips have over Google's, its incredible stamina, and the very fast charging. Two flaws we can note:Though the camera isn't the best, it is very good, and the versatility of its sensors plus the ability for raw capture means you can tweak whatever the camera gives out.The second flaw? Motorola isn't the best at delivering timely Android OS updates as Google. With Google moving away from that model, that may not be the dealbreaker it once was.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 Pro reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 40 Pro deals£1,552.39ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)2. Motorola Razr PlusThe best Motorola foldable you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:June 2023Weight:184.5g or 188.5gDimensions:170.8 x 74 x 7 mm (unfolded) 88.4 x 74 x 15.1 mm (folded)OS:Android 13Screen size:6.9-inch / 3.6-inchResolution:1080 x 2640 / 1056 x 1056CPU:Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1RAM:8GB/12GBStorage:256GB/512GBBattery:3,800mAhRear camera:12MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(Blue)View at Amazon(Black)View at AO - Mobile Phones Direct(256GB)Reasons to buy+More stylish than a Galaxy Z Flip 5+Huge cover display is actually useful+Cool vegan leather and unique colorsReasons to avoid-Last year’s specs-Not water resistant enough-Too expensive for what you geThe Motorola Razr Plus – sold globally as the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra – is the nicest Motorola foldable released so far and one of the best clamshell foldables to come out this year as a whole.In our review, we described it as a major evolutionary step for smartphones, one that goes beyond what previous ones have offered. With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves.When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content.There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was. It's aRazr-thin clamshell phone, and that's still awesome.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr Plus reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (904 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)24 monthsdata500GB£9upfrontMonthly£26.99/mth£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)36 monthsdata150GB£50upfrontMonthly£32/mth£50upfront£32/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB Peach)24 monthsdata250GB£9upfrontMonthly£34/mth£9upfront£34/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseShow More Deals(Image credit: Michael Allison / Future)3. Motorola Edge 40The nicest feeling Motorola phone you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:May 2023Weight:167/171gDimensions:158.4 x 72 x 7.6 mmOS:Android 13Screen size:6.55-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Mediatek Dimensity 8020RAM:8GBStorage:256GBBattery:4,400mAhRear camera:50MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Svelte design+Solid software+Attractive pricing+Fast 68W chargingReasons to avoid-Historically weak software support-Curved screen can be a bit annoying-Unremarkable haptics-Average cameraThe Motorola Edge 40 is the smaller counterpart to the Edge 40 Pro and the nicer-feeling of the duo. It's incredibly thin and light at a time when most phones are moving towards thicker and heavier, and it has excellent battery and charging despite all that. As with all Motorola phones, the software is clean and reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones. The MediaTek Dimensity chip is here to save costs, and it does so rather excellently, preserving power while maximizing performance and efficiency. MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was.It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language. It's a year old now, but that means you can get it for around $300, should you want it.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (63 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Edge 40 (256GB Black)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£17.75/mth£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£22.75/mth£30upfront£22.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£40upfrontMonthly£22.47/mth£40upfront£22.47/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandShow More Deals(Image credit: Future)4. Motorola Edge 30 UltraA premium alternativeOur expert review:Average Amazon review:☆☆☆☆☆SpecificationsRelease date:September 2022Weight:198.5gDimensions:161.8 x 73.5 x 8.4 mmOS:Android 12Screen size:6.67-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1RAM:8GB/12GBStorage:128GB/256GB/512GBBattery:4,610mAhRear camera:200MP + 12MP + 50MPFront camera:60MPToday's Best DealsView at Carphone WarehouseCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Premium design+Super-fast chargingReasons to avoid-200MP is unnecessary-Zoom camera could zoom furtherThe Motorola Edge 30 Ultra is fantastic value for a flagship phone. It has a high-end Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor that's ideal for power-hungry processes as well as gaming. A 144Hz refresh rate on its 6.67-inch FHD+ display looks great for all content from streaming to browsing online. A glass front and back with a metal frame ensures it looks expensive and premium too. Reviewing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, we felt it was quite reminiscent of the Edge 30 Ultra. Luckily, Motorola and other retailers have kept this phone around somewhat, and you're able o save some money now that it's been about a year.A 200MP main camera is potentially overkill for most people but it's a cool-sounding selling point and produces generally bright and colorful images.The presence of fast-charging with very good battery life will please most users. Rounding things off nicely is near-stock Android 12 (now updated to Android 13), ensuring you get a nice clean, customizable interface.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 30 Ultra reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 30 Ultra deals4 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆Free Lenovo Smart ...£749ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)5. Motorola Razr 2022Another foldable to considerAverage Amazon review:☆☆☆☆☆SpecificationsRelease date:August 2022Weight:200gDimensions:167.0 x 79.8 x 7.6 mm (unfolded) 86.5 x 79.8 x 17 mm (folded)OS:Android 12Screen size:6.7-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1RAM:8GB/12GBStorage:128GB/256GB/512GBBattery:3,500mAhRear camera:50MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsView at AmazonView at AmazonReasons to buy+Good battery life+Barely-there display creaseReasons to avoid-Performance issues-ExpensiveThe Motorola Razr 2022 addresses the issues of its predecessor. It has a 6.7-inch notch-free Full HD+ pOLED panel that looks great with a barely noticeable crease in the display. Ideal for split-screen multitasking and media, the Motorola Razr 2022 exudes style as you use it, thanks to that foldable design.A 144Hz refresh rate should mean it's ideal for gaming although its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip is unusually stuttery at times, suggesting poor optimization somewhere along the line.Despite that, the Motorola Razr 2022 is still attractive, thanks to its clean interface, decent battery life (for a clamshell foldable), and a surprisingly good camera, in the form of a large 50MP wide sensor with OIS and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool.The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets). As Motorola sells it at a discount currently, it still deserves a place on our list for the time being.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr 2022 reviewToday's best Motorola RAZR 2022 deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆£749View£1,099ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)6.

For anything else, think camera, fast charging, even mobile contactless payments, you'll have to look elsewhere. At £170 in the UK though, it's a compelling buy for people who just want the basics – and online reviews on retailers show buyers raving about the sheer value.Reviewing the Moto G53 5G, we found that Motorola made careful choices here to hit that low price point. The 120Hz refresh rate helps keep navigation smooth, and the phone felt nice to hold. There's even microSD support, a useful feature that's been losing presence in smartphones as higher base storage and cloud storage options both work to make that unnecessary in higher priced phones.Itisa phone that costs more than a little under £200 though, so you'll have to keep that in mind as you evaluate the camera, the plastic build, and the low-resolution display.Read our fullMotorola Moto G53 5G review hereToday's best Motorola Moto G53 5G deals£179.97ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesHow to choose the best Motorola phone for youThe first thing you need to ask yourself is ""how much am I willing to spend?"" If you've got no set budget, and can splash out a bit, the Edge or Razr series are what you'll want to consider. If you don't want to break the bank, though, stick to the G series, or perhaps the company's Neo branded phones for a happy medium.After that, think about what the key features you need are. Do you need a great camera? A durable device? A high-res screen? A long-lasting battery? Fast charging? Lots of performance power? Most of the G-series phones are decent in all areas, but certain models stand out in certain departments, and we've highlighted these in our rankings.You should also consider whether you want lots of software updates or if the newest version of Android isn't quite as important - Motorola doesn't always keep its handsets updated for very long, so older phones may already have been discontinued.Which Motorola phone is the newest?Despite releasing its phones in quite a sporadic pattern, there is a rhyme and a reason to the naming behind the phones.The Edge series sees a new number each year – in 2021 it was the Edge 20 series, and 2022 brought the Edge 30, and so on. The 2023 Razr line is a little more convoluted, as they're called the Razr and Razr Plus in the US, while elsewhere go by the Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra; either way, these latest foldables are the same pair of devices – all released in 2023.The G series is a little bit harder, but each new version gets a new suffix number - so if you see the G35 next to the G33, you know which is the newer version. The first number refers to the relative ranking, so the G55 will be as new as the G75, but not as high-end.How we test Motorola phonesSimple: we put our SIM cards into the phone we're testing, load all our apps and contracts, and simply use the Moto phone as our own for several weeks.This means we don't just test the performance, battery life and screen brightness in controlled lab settings, but we get a great idea of the everyday handling of each handset.This also helps us stumble upon the little quirks, both the good and bad ones, that you might not normally find just by looking at a phone: if there are specific software bugs, finicky fingerprint sensors, or if the phone overheats, we'll notice it.Since we test most of the smartphones released in key regions we report on, testing them in a hands-on way like this also means we can compare key features between phones, which really helps with creating rankings like the one above.Round up of today's best dealsContract DealsSim FreeMotorola Razr 40 Ultra24 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts500GBdata£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseSee all pricesMotorola Edge 4036 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts150GBdata£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered byGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Alex Walker-ToddSocial Links NavigationSenior Phones EditorAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

The company manages to keep pace with all the latest specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, large amounts of RAM and storage, and a super bright screen paired with a high refresh rate.After reviewing it, we feel it's the closest thing you'll get to a Pixel-like experience without buying one ofGoogle's Pixel handsets. It could even be better when one considers the advantages Qualcomm's chips have over Google's, its incredible stamina, and the very fast charging. Two flaws we can note:Though the camera isn't the best, it is very good, and the versatility of its sensors plus the ability for raw capture means you can tweak whatever the camera gives out.The second flaw? Motorola isn't the best at delivering timely Android OS updates as Google. With Google moving away from that model, that may not be the dealbreaker it once was.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 Pro reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 40 Pro deals£1,552.39ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)2.

With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves.When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content.There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was. It's aRazr-thin clamshell phone, and that's still awesome.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr Plus reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (904 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)24 monthsdata500GB£9upfrontMonthly£26.99/mth£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)36 monthsdata150GB£50upfrontMonthly£32/mth£50upfront£32/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB Peach)24 monthsdata250GB£9upfrontMonthly£34/mth£9upfront£34/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseShow More Deals(Image credit: Michael Allison / Future)3. Motorola Edge 40The nicest feeling Motorola phone you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:May 2023Weight:167/171gDimensions:158.4 x 72 x 7.6 mmOS:Android 13Screen size:6.55-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Mediatek Dimensity 8020RAM:8GBStorage:256GBBattery:4,400mAhRear camera:50MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Svelte design+Solid software+Attractive pricing+Fast 68W chargingReasons to avoid-Historically weak software support-Curved screen can be a bit annoying-Unremarkable haptics-Average cameraThe Motorola Edge 40 is the smaller counterpart to the Edge 40 Pro and the nicer-feeling of the duo. It's incredibly thin and light at a time when most phones are moving towards thicker and heavier, and it has excellent battery and charging despite all that. As with all Motorola phones, the software is clean and reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones. The MediaTek Dimensity chip is here to save costs, and it does so rather excellently, preserving power while maximizing performance and efficiency. MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was.It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language. It's a year old now, but that means you can get it for around $300, should you want it.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (63 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Edge 40 (256GB Black)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£17.75/mth£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£22.75/mth£30upfront£22.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£40upfrontMonthly£22.47/mth£40upfront£22.47/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandShow More Deals(Image credit: Future)4.

It has a high-end Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor that's ideal for power-hungry processes as well as gaming. A 144Hz refresh rate on its 6.67-inch FHD+ display looks great for all content from streaming to browsing online. A glass front and back with a metal frame ensures it looks expensive and premium too. Reviewing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, we felt it was quite reminiscent of the Edge 30 Ultra. Luckily, Motorola and other retailers have kept this phone around somewhat, and you're able o save some money now that it's been about a year.A 200MP main camera is potentially overkill for most people but it's a cool-sounding selling point and produces generally bright and colorful images.The presence of fast-charging with very good battery life will please most users. Rounding things off nicely is near-stock Android 12 (now updated to Android 13), ensuring you get a nice clean, customizable interface.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 30 Ultra reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 30 Ultra deals4 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆Free Lenovo Smart ...£749ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)5.

It has a 6.7-inch notch-free Full HD+ pOLED panel that looks great with a barely noticeable crease in the display. Ideal for split-screen multitasking and media, the Motorola Razr 2022 exudes style as you use it, thanks to that foldable design.A 144Hz refresh rate should mean it's ideal for gaming although its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip is unusually stuttery at times, suggesting poor optimization somewhere along the line.Despite that, the Motorola Razr 2022 is still attractive, thanks to its clean interface, decent battery life (for a clamshell foldable), and a surprisingly good camera, in the form of a large 50MP wide sensor with OIS and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool.The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets). As Motorola sells it at a discount currently, it still deserves a place on our list for the time being.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr 2022 reviewToday's best Motorola RAZR 2022 deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆£749View£1,099ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)6.

With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves.When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content.There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was.

MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was.It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language.

Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool.The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets).

For anything else, think camera, fast charging, even mobile contactless payments, you'll have to look elsewhere. At £170 in the UK though, it's a compelling buy for people who just want the basics – and online reviews on retailers show buyers raving about the sheer value.Reviewing the Moto G53 5G, we found that Motorola made careful choices here to hit that low price point. The 120Hz refresh rate helps keep navigation smooth, and the phone felt nice to hold. There's even microSD support, a useful feature that's been losing presence in smartphones as higher base storage and cloud storage options both work to make that unnecessary in higher priced phones.Itisa phone that costs more than a little under £200 though, so you'll have to keep that in mind as you evaluate the camera, the plastic build, and the low-resolution display.Read our fullMotorola Moto G53 5G review hereToday's best Motorola Moto G53 5G deals£179.97ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesHow to choose the best Motorola phone for youThe first thing you need to ask yourself is ""how much am I willing to spend?"" If you've got no set budget, and can splash out a bit, the Edge or Razr series are what you'll want to consider. If you don't want to break the bank, though, stick to the G series, or perhaps the company's Neo branded phones for a happy medium.After that, think about what the key features you need are. Do you need a great camera? A durable device? A high-res screen? A long-lasting battery? Fast charging? Lots of performance power? Most of the G-series phones are decent in all areas, but certain models stand out in certain departments, and we've highlighted these in our rankings.You should also consider whether you want lots of software updates or if the newest version of Android isn't quite as important - Motorola doesn't always keep its handsets updated for very long, so older phones may already have been discontinued.Which Motorola phone is the newest?Despite releasing its phones in quite a sporadic pattern, there is a rhyme and a reason to the naming behind the phones.The Edge series sees a new number each year – in 2021 it was the Edge 20 series, and 2022 brought the Edge 30, and so on. The 2023 Razr line is a little more convoluted, as they're called the Razr and Razr Plus in the US, while elsewhere go by the Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra; either way, these latest foldables are the same pair of devices – all released in 2023.The G series is a little bit harder, but each new version gets a new suffix number - so if you see the G35 next to the G33, you know which is the newer version. The first number refers to the relative ranking, so the G55 will be as new as the G75, but not as high-end.How we test Motorola phonesSimple: we put our SIM cards into the phone we're testing, load all our apps and contracts, and simply use the Moto phone as our own for several weeks.This means we don't just test the performance, battery life and screen brightness in controlled lab settings, but we get a great idea of the everyday handling of each handset.This also helps us stumble upon the little quirks, both the good and bad ones, that you might not normally find just by looking at a phone: if there are specific software bugs, finicky fingerprint sensors, or if the phone overheats, we'll notice it.Since we test most of the smartphones released in key regions we report on, testing them in a hands-on way like this also means we can compare key features between phones, which really helps with creating rankings like the one above.Round up of today's best dealsContract DealsSim FreeMotorola Razr 40 Ultra24 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts500GBdata£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseSee all pricesMotorola Edge 4036 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts150GBdata£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered byGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Alex Walker-ToddSocial Links NavigationSenior Phones EditorAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

Recently, it's been on something of a streak too, with a run of well-designed, well-specced devices, that have impressed us in reviews.The brand also everything from classic candy bar smartphones to clamshells that we think are some of thebest foldable phonesyou can buy. So, whatever handheld you're looking for, you'll likely find one to suit your needs amidst its line-up.We've extensively tested and reviewed quite a few Motorola handsets by way of a full review. This means we've tested and lived with them for a period of a few weeks in order to bring you as honest and realistic a breakdown of the experience offered up by each phone as possible. And to help you along, we've listed all the best Motorola phones below. They're ranked according to our preference, but don't be afraid to choose one of the lower-ranked options, as they'll still be excellent for some people.If none on this list catches your eye, don't worry. We're constantly updating this guide and make sure to add any new models that are worthy of a spot on the list (and removing old models which have seen better days). Though, if you've decided that a Motorola phone still isn't for you, you should take a look at ourbest Android phonesorbest iPhonesguides as well.The best Motorola phones 2024Why you can trust TechRadarWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)1.

The company manages to keep pace with all the latest specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, large amounts of RAM and storage, and a super bright screen paired with a high refresh rate.After reviewing it, we feel it's the closest thing you'll get to a Pixel-like experience without buying one ofGoogle's Pixel handsets. It could even be better when one considers the advantages Qualcomm's chips have over Google's, its incredible stamina, and the very fast charging. Two flaws we can note:Though the camera isn't the best, it is very good, and the versatility of its sensors plus the ability for raw capture means you can tweak whatever the camera gives out.The second flaw? Motorola isn't the best at delivering timely Android OS updates as Google. With Google moving away from that model, that may not be the dealbreaker it once was.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 Pro reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 40 Pro deals£1,552.39ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)2.

At £170 in the UK though, it's a compelling buy for people who just want the basics – and online reviews on retailers show buyers raving about the sheer value.Reviewing the Moto G53 5G, we found that Motorola made careful choices here to hit that low price point. The 120Hz refresh rate helps keep navigation smooth, and the phone felt nice to hold. There's even microSD support, a useful feature that's been losing presence in smartphones as higher base storage and cloud storage options both work to make that unnecessary in higher priced phones.Itisa phone that costs more than a little under £200 though, so you'll have to keep that in mind as you evaluate the camera, the plastic build, and the low-resolution display.Read our fullMotorola Moto G53 5G review hereToday's best Motorola Moto G53 5G deals£179.97ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesHow to choose the best Motorola phone for youThe first thing you need to ask yourself is ""how much am I willing to spend?"" If you've got no set budget, and can splash out a bit, the Edge or Razr series are what you'll want to consider. If you don't want to break the bank, though, stick to the G series, or perhaps the company's Neo branded phones for a happy medium.After that, think about what the key features you need are. Do you need a great camera? A durable device? A high-res screen? A long-lasting battery? Fast charging? Lots of performance power? Most of the G-series phones are decent in all areas, but certain models stand out in certain departments, and we've highlighted these in our rankings.You should also consider whether you want lots of software updates or if the newest version of Android isn't quite as important - Motorola doesn't always keep its handsets updated for very long, so older phones may already have been discontinued.Which Motorola phone is the newest?Despite releasing its phones in quite a sporadic pattern, there is a rhyme and a reason to the naming behind the phones.The Edge series sees a new number each year – in 2021 it was the Edge 20 series, and 2022 brought the Edge 30, and so on. The 2023 Razr line is a little more convoluted, as they're called the Razr and Razr Plus in the US, while elsewhere go by the Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra; either way, these latest foldables are the same pair of devices – all released in 2023.The G series is a little bit harder, but each new version gets a new suffix number - so if you see the G35 next to the G33, you know which is the newer version. The first number refers to the relative ranking, so the G55 will be as new as the G75, but not as high-end.How we test Motorola phonesSimple: we put our SIM cards into the phone we're testing, load all our apps and contracts, and simply use the Moto phone as our own for several weeks.This means we don't just test the performance, battery life and screen brightness in controlled lab settings, but we get a great idea of the everyday handling of each handset.This also helps us stumble upon the little quirks, both the good and bad ones, that you might not normally find just by looking at a phone: if there are specific software bugs, finicky fingerprint sensors, or if the phone overheats, we'll notice it.Since we test most of the smartphones released in key regions we report on, testing them in a hands-on way like this also means we can compare key features between phones, which really helps with creating rankings like the one above.Round up of today's best dealsContract DealsSim FreeMotorola Razr 40 Ultra24 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts500GBdata£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseSee all pricesMotorola Edge 4036 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts150GBdata£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered byGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Alex Walker-ToddSocial Links NavigationSenior Phones EditorAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

PRICEVERDICTREASONS TO BUYREASONS TO AVOIDVERDICTREASONS TO BUYREASONS TO AVOID(Image credit: Future | Motorola)Motorola is one of the most iconic phone makers of all time, and it's produced a wealth of fantastic phones over the years. Recently, it's been on something of a streak too, with a run of well-designed, well-specced devices, that have impressed us in reviews.The brand also everything from classic candy bar smartphones to clamshells that we think are some of thebest foldable phonesyou can buy. So, whatever handheld you're looking for, you'll likely find one to suit your needs amidst its line-up.We've extensively tested and reviewed quite a few Motorola handsets by way of a full review. This means we've tested and lived with them for a period of a few weeks in order to bring you as honest and realistic a breakdown of the experience offered up by each phone as possible. And to help you along, we've listed all the best Motorola phones below. They're ranked according to our preference, but don't be afraid to choose one of the lower-ranked options, as they'll still be excellent for some people.If none on this list catches your eye, don't worry. We're constantly updating this guide and make sure to add any new models that are worthy of a spot on the list (and removing old models which have seen better days). Though, if you've decided that a Motorola phone still isn't for you, you should take a look at ourbest Android phonesorbest iPhonesguides as well.The best Motorola phones 2024Why you can trust TechRadarWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best.Find out more about how we test.(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann)1.

The company manages to keep pace with all the latest specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, large amounts of RAM and storage, and a super bright screen paired with a high refresh rate.After reviewing it, we feel it's the closest thing you'll get to a Pixel-like experience without buying one ofGoogle's Pixel handsets. It could even be better when one considers the advantages Qualcomm's chips have over Google's, its incredible stamina, and the very fast charging. Two flaws we can note:Though the camera isn't the best, it is very good, and the versatility of its sensors plus the ability for raw capture means you can tweak whatever the camera gives out.The second flaw? Motorola isn't the best at delivering timely Android OS updates as Google. With Google moving away from that model, that may not be the dealbreaker it once was.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 Pro reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 40 Pro deals£1,552.39ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)2. Motorola Razr PlusThe best Motorola foldable you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:June 2023Weight:184.5g or 188.5gDimensions:170.8 x 74 x 7 mm (unfolded) 88.4 x 74 x 15.1 mm (folded)OS:Android 13Screen size:6.9-inch / 3.6-inchResolution:1080 x 2640 / 1056 x 1056CPU:Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1RAM:8GB/12GBStorage:256GB/512GBBattery:3,800mAhRear camera:12MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(Blue)View at Amazon(Black)View at AO - Mobile Phones Direct(256GB)Reasons to buy+More stylish than a Galaxy Z Flip 5+Huge cover display is actually useful+Cool vegan leather and unique colorsReasons to avoid-Last year’s specs-Not water resistant enough-Too expensive for what you geThe Motorola Razr Plus – sold globally as the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra – is the nicest Motorola foldable released so far and one of the best clamshell foldables to come out this year as a whole.In our review, we described it as a major evolutionary step for smartphones, one that goes beyond what previous ones have offered. With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves.When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content.There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was. It's aRazr-thin clamshell phone, and that's still awesome.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr Plus reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (904 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)24 monthsdata500GB£9upfrontMonthly£26.99/mth£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)36 monthsdata150GB£50upfrontMonthly£32/mth£50upfront£32/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB Peach)24 monthsdata250GB£9upfrontMonthly£34/mth£9upfront£34/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseShow More Deals(Image credit: Michael Allison / Future)3. Motorola Edge 40The nicest feeling Motorola phone you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:May 2023Weight:167/171gDimensions:158.4 x 72 x 7.6 mmOS:Android 13Screen size:6.55-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Mediatek Dimensity 8020RAM:8GBStorage:256GBBattery:4,400mAhRear camera:50MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Svelte design+Solid software+Attractive pricing+Fast 68W chargingReasons to avoid-Historically weak software support-Curved screen can be a bit annoying-Unremarkable haptics-Average cameraThe Motorola Edge 40 is the smaller counterpart to the Edge 40 Pro and the nicer-feeling of the duo. It's incredibly thin and light at a time when most phones are moving towards thicker and heavier, and it has excellent battery and charging despite all that. As with all Motorola phones, the software is clean and reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones. The MediaTek Dimensity chip is here to save costs, and it does so rather excellently, preserving power while maximizing performance and efficiency. MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was.It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language. It's a year old now, but that means you can get it for around $300, should you want it.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (63 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Edge 40 (256GB Black)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£17.75/mth£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£22.75/mth£30upfront£22.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£40upfrontMonthly£22.47/mth£40upfront£22.47/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandShow More Deals(Image credit: Future)4.

It has a high-end Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor that's ideal for power-hungry processes as well as gaming. A 144Hz refresh rate on its 6.67-inch FHD+ display looks great for all content from streaming to browsing online. A glass front and back with a metal frame ensures it looks expensive and premium too. Reviewing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, we felt it was quite reminiscent of the Edge 30 Ultra. Luckily, Motorola and other retailers have kept this phone around somewhat, and you're able o save some money now that it's been about a year.A 200MP main camera is potentially overkill for most people but it's a cool-sounding selling point and produces generally bright and colorful images.The presence of fast-charging with very good battery life will please most users. Rounding things off nicely is near-stock Android 12 (now updated to Android 13), ensuring you get a nice clean, customizable interface.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 30 Ultra reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 30 Ultra deals4 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆Free Lenovo Smart ...£749ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)5.

It has a 6.7-inch notch-free Full HD+ pOLED panel that looks great with a barely noticeable crease in the display. Ideal for split-screen multitasking and media, the Motorola Razr 2022 exudes style as you use it, thanks to that foldable design.A 144Hz refresh rate should mean it's ideal for gaming although its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip is unusually stuttery at times, suggesting poor optimization somewhere along the line.Despite that, the Motorola Razr 2022 is still attractive, thanks to its clean interface, decent battery life (for a clamshell foldable), and a surprisingly good camera, in the form of a large 50MP wide sensor with OIS and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool.The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets). As Motorola sells it at a discount currently, it still deserves a place on our list for the time being.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr 2022 reviewToday's best Motorola RAZR 2022 deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆£749View£1,099ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)6.

With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves.When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content.There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was. It's aRazr-thin clamshell phone, and that's still awesome.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr Plus reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (904 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)24 monthsdata500GB£9upfrontMonthly£26.99/mth£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)36 monthsdata150GB£50upfrontMonthly£32/mth£50upfront£32/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB Peach)24 monthsdata250GB£9upfrontMonthly£34/mth£9upfront£34/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseShow More Deals(Image credit: Michael Allison / Future)3.

It's incredibly thin and light at a time when most phones are moving towards thicker and heavier, and it has excellent battery and charging despite all that. As with all Motorola phones, the software is clean and reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones. The MediaTek Dimensity chip is here to save costs, and it does so rather excellently, preserving power while maximizing performance and efficiency. MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was.It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language. It's a year old now, but that means you can get it for around $300, should you want it.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (63 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Edge 40 (256GB Black)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£17.75/mth£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£22.75/mth£30upfront£22.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£40upfrontMonthly£22.47/mth£40upfront£22.47/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandShow More Deals(Image credit: Future)4.

It has a high-end Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor that's ideal for power-hungry processes as well as gaming. A 144Hz refresh rate on its 6.67-inch FHD+ display looks great for all content from streaming to browsing online. A glass front and back with a metal frame ensures it looks expensive and premium too. Reviewing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, we felt it was quite reminiscent of the Edge 30 Ultra. Luckily, Motorola and other retailers have kept this phone around somewhat, and you're able o save some money now that it's been about a year.A 200MP main camera is potentially overkill for most people but it's a cool-sounding selling point and produces generally bright and colorful images.The presence of fast-charging with very good battery life will please most users. Rounding things off nicely is near-stock Android 12 (now updated to Android 13), ensuring you get a nice clean, customizable interface.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 30 Ultra reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 30 Ultra deals4 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆Free Lenovo Smart ...£749ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)5.

It has a 6.7-inch notch-free Full HD+ pOLED panel that looks great with a barely noticeable crease in the display. Ideal for split-screen multitasking and media, the Motorola Razr 2022 exudes style as you use it, thanks to that foldable design.A 144Hz refresh rate should mean it's ideal for gaming although its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip is unusually stuttery at times, suggesting poor optimization somewhere along the line.Despite that, the Motorola Razr 2022 is still attractive, thanks to its clean interface, decent battery life (for a clamshell foldable), and a surprisingly good camera, in the form of a large 50MP wide sensor with OIS and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool.The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets). As Motorola sells it at a discount currently, it still deserves a place on our list for the time being.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr 2022 reviewToday's best Motorola RAZR 2022 deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆£749View£1,099ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)6.

For anything else, think camera, fast charging, even mobile contactless payments, you'll have to look elsewhere. At £170 in the UK though, it's a compelling buy for people who just want the basics – and online reviews on retailers show buyers raving about the sheer value.Reviewing the Moto G53 5G, we found that Motorola made careful choices here to hit that low price point. The 120Hz refresh rate helps keep navigation smooth, and the phone felt nice to hold. There's even microSD support, a useful feature that's been losing presence in smartphones as higher base storage and cloud storage options both work to make that unnecessary in higher priced phones.Itisa phone that costs more than a little under £200 though, so you'll have to keep that in mind as you evaluate the camera, the plastic build, and the low-resolution display.Read our fullMotorola Moto G53 5G review hereToday's best Motorola Moto G53 5G deals£179.97ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesHow to choose the best Motorola phone for youThe first thing you need to ask yourself is ""how much am I willing to spend?"" If you've got no set budget, and can splash out a bit, the Edge or Razr series are what you'll want to consider. If you don't want to break the bank, though, stick to the G series, or perhaps the company's Neo branded phones for a happy medium.After that, think about what the key features you need are. Do you need a great camera? A durable device? A high-res screen? A long-lasting battery? Fast charging? Lots of performance power? Most of the G-series phones are decent in all areas, but certain models stand out in certain departments, and we've highlighted these in our rankings.You should also consider whether you want lots of software updates or if the newest version of Android isn't quite as important - Motorola doesn't always keep its handsets updated for very long, so older phones may already have been discontinued.Which Motorola phone is the newest?Despite releasing its phones in quite a sporadic pattern, there is a rhyme and a reason to the naming behind the phones.The Edge series sees a new number each year – in 2021 it was the Edge 20 series, and 2022 brought the Edge 30, and so on. The 2023 Razr line is a little more convoluted, as they're called the Razr and Razr Plus in the US, while elsewhere go by the Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra; either way, these latest foldables are the same pair of devices – all released in 2023.The G series is a little bit harder, but each new version gets a new suffix number - so if you see the G35 next to the G33, you know which is the newer version. The first number refers to the relative ranking, so the G55 will be as new as the G75, but not as high-end.How we test Motorola phonesSimple: we put our SIM cards into the phone we're testing, load all our apps and contracts, and simply use the Moto phone as our own for several weeks.This means we don't just test the performance, battery life and screen brightness in controlled lab settings, but we get a great idea of the everyday handling of each handset.This also helps us stumble upon the little quirks, both the good and bad ones, that you might not normally find just by looking at a phone: if there are specific software bugs, finicky fingerprint sensors, or if the phone overheats, we'll notice it.Since we test most of the smartphones released in key regions we report on, testing them in a hands-on way like this also means we can compare key features between phones, which really helps with creating rankings like the one above.Round up of today's best dealsContract DealsSim FreeMotorola Razr 40 Ultra24 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts500GBdata£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseSee all pricesMotorola Edge 4036 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts150GBdata£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered byGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Alex Walker-ToddSocial Links NavigationSenior Phones EditorAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

Recently, it's been on something of a streak too, with a run of well-designed, well-specced devices, that have impressed us in reviews.The brand also everything from classic candy bar smartphones to clamshells that we think are some of thebest foldable phonesyou can buy. So, whatever handheld you're looking for, you'll likely find one to suit your needs amidst its line-up.We've extensively tested and reviewed quite a few Motorola handsets by way of a full review. This means we've tested and lived with them for a period of a few weeks in order to bring you as honest and realistic a breakdown of the experience offered up by each phone as possible. And to help you along, we've listed all the best Motorola phones below. They're ranked according to our preference, but don't be afraid to choose one of the lower-ranked options, as they'll still be excellent for some people.If none on this list catches your eye, don't worry. We're constantly updating this guide and make sure to add any new models that are worthy of a spot on the list (and removing old models which have seen better days).

The company manages to keep pace with all the latest specs, including the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, large amounts of RAM and storage, and a super bright screen paired with a high refresh rate.After reviewing it, we feel it's the closest thing you'll get to a Pixel-like experience without buying one ofGoogle's Pixel handsets. It could even be better when one considers the advantages Qualcomm's chips have over Google's, its incredible stamina, and the very fast charging. Two flaws we can note:Though the camera isn't the best, it is very good, and the versatility of its sensors plus the ability for raw capture means you can tweak whatever the camera gives out.The second flaw? Motorola isn't the best at delivering timely Android OS updates as Google. With Google moving away from that model, that may not be the dealbreaker it once was.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 Pro reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 40 Pro deals£1,552.39ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future | Alex Walker-Todd)2.

There's even microSD support, a useful feature that's been losing presence in smartphones as higher base storage and cloud storage options both work to make that unnecessary in higher priced phones.Itisa phone that costs more than a little under £200 though, so you'll have to keep that in mind as you evaluate the camera, the plastic build, and the low-resolution display.Read our fullMotorola Moto G53 5G review hereToday's best Motorola Moto G53 5G deals£179.97ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesHow to choose the best Motorola phone for youThe first thing you need to ask yourself is ""how much am I willing to spend?"" If you've got no set budget, and can splash out a bit, the Edge or Razr series are what you'll want to consider. If you don't want to break the bank, though, stick to the G series, or perhaps the company's Neo branded phones for a happy medium.After that, think about what the key features you need are. Do you need a great camera? A durable device? A high-res screen? A long-lasting battery? Fast charging? Lots of performance power? Most of the G-series phones are decent in all areas, but certain models stand out in certain departments, and we've highlighted these in our rankings.You should also consider whether you want lots of software updates or if the newest version of Android isn't quite as important - Motorola doesn't always keep its handsets updated for very long, so older phones may already have been discontinued.Which Motorola phone is the newest?Despite releasing its phones in quite a sporadic pattern, there is a rhyme and a reason to the naming behind the phones.The Edge series sees a new number each year – in 2021 it was the Edge 20 series, and 2022 brought the Edge 30, and so on. The 2023 Razr line is a little more convoluted, as they're called the Razr and Razr Plus in the US, while elsewhere go by the Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra; either way, these latest foldables are the same pair of devices – all released in 2023.The G series is a little bit harder, but each new version gets a new suffix number - so if you see the G35 next to the G33, you know which is the newer version. The first number refers to the relative ranking, so the G55 will be as new as the G75, but not as high-end.How we test Motorola phonesSimple: we put our SIM cards into the phone we're testing, load all our apps and contracts, and simply use the Moto phone as our own for several weeks.This means we don't just test the performance, battery life and screen brightness in controlled lab settings, but we get a great idea of the everyday handling of each handset.This also helps us stumble upon the little quirks, both the good and bad ones, that you might not normally find just by looking at a phone: if there are specific software bugs, finicky fingerprint sensors, or if the phone overheats, we'll notice it.Since we test most of the smartphones released in key regions we report on, testing them in a hands-on way like this also means we can compare key features between phones, which really helps with creating rankings like the one above.Round up of today's best dealsContract DealsSim FreeMotorola Razr 40 Ultra24 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts500GBdata£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseSee all pricesMotorola Edge 4036 monthsUnlimitedminsUnlimitedtexts150GBdata£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered byGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Alex Walker-ToddSocial Links NavigationSenior Phones EditorAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

So, whatever handheld you're looking for, you'll likely find one to suit your needs amidst its line-up.We've extensively tested and reviewed quite a few Motorola handsets by way of a full review.

It could even be better when one considers the advantages Qualcomm's chips have over Google's, its incredible stamina, and the very fast charging. Two flaws we can note:Though the camera isn't the best, it is very good, and the versatility of its sensors plus the ability for raw capture means you can tweak whatever the camera gives out.The second flaw?

With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves.When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content.There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was. It's aRazr-thin clamshell phone, and that's still awesome.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr Plus reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (904 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)24 monthsdata500GB£9upfrontMonthly£26.99/mth£9upfront£26.99/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB LED)36 monthsdata150GB£50upfrontMonthly£32/mth£50upfront£32/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Razr 40 Ultra (256GB Peach)24 monthsdata250GB£9upfrontMonthly£34/mth£9upfront£34/mthViewatCarphone WarehouseShow More Deals(Image credit: Michael Allison / Future)3. Motorola Edge 40The nicest feeling Motorola phone you can buyOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:May 2023Weight:167/171gDimensions:158.4 x 72 x 7.6 mmOS:Android 13Screen size:6.55-inchResolution:1080 x 2400CPU:Mediatek Dimensity 8020RAM:8GBStorage:256GBBattery:4,400mAhRear camera:50MP + 13MPFront camera:32MPToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Svelte design+Solid software+Attractive pricing+Fast 68W chargingReasons to avoid-Historically weak software support-Curved screen can be a bit annoying-Unremarkable haptics-Average cameraThe Motorola Edge 40 is the smaller counterpart to the Edge 40 Pro and the nicer-feeling of the duo. It's incredibly thin and light at a time when most phones are moving towards thicker and heavier, and it has excellent battery and charging despite all that. As with all Motorola phones, the software is clean and reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones. The MediaTek Dimensity chip is here to save costs, and it does so rather excellently, preserving power while maximizing performance and efficiency. MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was.It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language. It's a year old now, but that means you can get it for around $300, should you want it.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 40 reviewPrice comparison: Find the best deal for your next phoneContract DealsSim FreeRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Contract DealsSim FreeSee all prices (63 found)FilterRecommendedData (high to low)Data (low to high)Monthly cost (high to low)Monthly cost (low to high)Price (high to low)Price (low to high)Motorola Edge 40 (256GB Black)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£17.75/mth£30upfront£17.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£30upfrontMonthly£22.75/mth£30upfront£22.75/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandMotorola Edge 40 (256GB OLED)36 monthsdata150GB£40upfrontMonthly£22.47/mth£40upfront£22.47/mthViewatThree Home BroadbandShow More Deals(Image credit: Future)4.

It has a high-end Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor that's ideal for power-hungry processes as well as gaming. A 144Hz refresh rate on its 6.67-inch FHD+ display looks great for all content from streaming to browsing online. A glass front and back with a metal frame ensures it looks expensive and premium too. Reviewing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, we felt it was quite reminiscent of the Edge 30 Ultra. Luckily, Motorola and other retailers have kept this phone around somewhat, and you're able o save some money now that it's been about a year.A 200MP main camera is potentially overkill for most people but it's a cool-sounding selling point and produces generally bright and colorful images.The presence of fast-charging with very good battery life will please most users. Rounding things off nicely is near-stock Android 12 (now updated to Android 13), ensuring you get a nice clean, customizable interface.Read our in-depthMotorola Edge 30 Ultra reviewToday's best Motorola Edge 30 Ultra deals4 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆Free Lenovo Smart ...£749ViewNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future / Alex Walker-Todd)5.

It has a 6.7-inch notch-free Full HD+ pOLED panel that looks great with a barely noticeable crease in the display. Ideal for split-screen multitasking and media, the Motorola Razr 2022 exudes style as you use it, thanks to that foldable design.A 144Hz refresh rate should mean it's ideal for gaming although its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip is unusually stuttery at times, suggesting poor optimization somewhere along the line.Despite that, the Motorola Razr 2022 is still attractive, thanks to its clean interface, decent battery life (for a clamshell foldable), and a surprisingly good camera, in the form of a large 50MP wide sensor with OIS and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool.The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets). As Motorola sells it at a discount currently, it still deserves a place on our list for the time being.Read our in-depthMotorola Razr 2022 reviewToday's best Motorola RAZR 2022 deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆£749View£1,099ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: Future)6.

In our review, we described it as a major evolutionary step for smartphones, one that goes beyond what previous ones have offered. With the Galaxy Z Flip 5 out, that's not necessarily so sure anymore, but it matters little. The Razr Plus stands on its own as an excellent phone. When unfolded, it's so thin as to recall the original Razr, while the huge display means your content receives the breathing room it deserves. When the display is closed, a large square external screen offers access to select apps that still encourage you to get off your phone so as to preserve the concept of these clamshell foldables, while still allowing you access to content. There are few flaws here, but none that we can't forgive. The older processor? Still serviceable right now. Slower updates? As we noted with the Edge 40 Pro, that's not as important in today's market as it once was. It's aRazr-thin clamshell phone, and that's still awesome.

It's incredibly thin and light at a time when most phones are moving towards thicker and heavier, and it has excellent battery and charging despite all that. As with all Motorola phones, the software is clean and reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones. The MediaTek Dimensity chip is here to save costs, and it does so rather excellently, preserving power while maximizing performance and efficiency. MediaTek is no longer the black mark it once was. It has a couple of flaws, most notably the average cameras. That's a Motorola flaw, and one you'd have to deal with if you're going to enjoy this phone. It's also likely to be a victim of Motorola's inconsistent software update policy. That is to say, you'll get updates. When? Well, that's up for debate. Depending on where you are, it may be available far more widely than the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, and at a more attractive price. It is not currently being sold in the US.In the meantime, you can consider theMotorola Edge 30 Fusionas a similar US alternative. It has a premium design and looks really close to the Edge 40 and was crafted at a time when Motorola started adopting that design language. It's a year old now, but that means you can get it for around $300, should you want it.

It has a high-end Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor that's ideal for power-hungry processes as well as gaming. A 144Hz refresh rate on its 6.67-inch FHD+ display looks great for all content from streaming to browsing online. A glass front and back with a metal frame ensures it looks expensive and premium too. Reviewing the Motorola Edge 40 Pro, we felt it was quite reminiscent of the Edge 30 Ultra. Luckily, Motorola and other retailers have kept this phone around somewhat, and you're able o save some money now that it's been about a year. A 200MP main camera is potentially overkill for most people but it's a cool-sounding selling point and produces generally bright and colorful images.

It has a 6.7-inch notch-free Full HD+ pOLED panel that looks great with a barely noticeable crease in the display. Ideal for split-screen multitasking and media, the Motorola Razr 2022 exudes style as you use it, thanks to that foldable design. A 144Hz refresh rate should mean it's ideal for gaming although its Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip is unusually stuttery at times, suggesting poor optimization somewhere along the line. Despite that, the Motorola Razr 2022 is still attractive, thanks to its clean interface, decent battery life (for a clamshell foldable), and a surprisingly good camera, in the form of a large 50MP wide sensor with OIS and a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Throw in the in-display 32MP selfie camera and this older RAZR makes for a pleasant dip in the foldable pool. The Razr has since been superseded by the Razr 2023 (sold as the Razr 40 in some markets). As Motorola sells it at a discount currently, it still deserves a place on our list for the time being.

For anything else, think camera, fast charging, even mobile contactless payments, you'll have to look elsewhere. At £170 in the UK though, it's a compelling buy for people who just want the basics – and online reviews on retailers show buyers raving about the sheer value. Reviewing the Moto G53 5G, we found that Motorola made careful choices here to hit that low price point. The 120Hz refresh rate helps keep navigation smooth, and the phone felt nice to hold. There's even microSD support, a useful feature that's been losing presence in smartphones as higher base storage and cloud storage options both work to make that unnecessary in higher priced phones. Itisa phone that costs more than a little under £200 though, so you'll have to keep that in mind as you evaluate the camera, the plastic build, and the low-resolution display.

If you've got no set budget, and can splash out a bit, the Edge or Razr series are what you'll want to consider. If you don't want to break the bank, though, stick to the G series, or perhaps the company's Neo branded phones for a happy medium.After that, think about what the key features you need are. Do you need a great camera? A durable device? A high-res screen? A long-lasting battery? Fast charging? Lots of performance power? Most of the G-series phones are decent in all areas, but certain models stand out in certain departments, and we've highlighted these in our rankings.You should also consider whether you want lots of software updates or if the newest version of Android isn't quite as important - Motorola doesn't always keep its handsets updated for very long, so older phones may already have been discontinued.

Which Motorola phone is the newest?Despite releasing its phones in quite a sporadic pattern, there is a rhyme and a reason to the naming behind the phones.The Edge series sees a new number each year – in 2021 it was the Edge 20 series, and 2022 brought the Edge 30, and so on. The 2023 Razr line is a little more convoluted, as they're called the Razr and Razr Plus in the US, while elsewhere go by the Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra; either way, these latest foldables are the same pair of devices – all released in 2023.The G series is a little bit harder, but each new version gets a new suffix number - so if you see the G35 next to the G33, you know which is the newer version. The first number refers to the relative ranking, so the G55 will be as new as the G75, but not as high-end. Which Motorola phone is the newest?

How we test Motorola phones Simple: we put our SIM cards into the phone we're testing, load all our apps and contracts, and simply use the Moto phone as our own for several weeks. This means we don't just test the performance, battery life and screen brightness in controlled lab settings, but we get a great idea of the everyday handling of each handset. This also helps us stumble upon the little quirks, both the good and bad ones, that you might not normally find just by looking at a phone: if there are specific software bugs, finicky fingerprint sensors, or if the phone overheats, we'll notice it. Since we test most of the smartphones released in key regions we report on, testing them in a hands-on way like this also means we can compare key features between phones, which really helps with creating rankings like the one above.
