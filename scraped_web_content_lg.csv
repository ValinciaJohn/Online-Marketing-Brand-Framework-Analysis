It has a big, bright display that looks great, although it only has a 60Hz refresh rate - normal for most phones, but similar spec flagships like the OnePlus 8 Pro andSamsungGalaxy S20 have 120Hz, making them more fluid looking.The V60 excels in battery life with a genuine two day battery life, top performance from the Snapdragon 865 chip and 5G compatibility. Most purchases also come with the Dual Screen case. It’s bulky, but adds a second screen so you can run two apps side by side or use it as a Nintendo 3DS-style game pad.With a Quad-DAC headphone jack and superb video controls for the dual cameras, the LG V60 is a content creator’s ideal smartphone.Read ourLG V60 ThinQ 5G review.Today's best LG V60 ThinQ 5G dealsNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)2.

Although it has effectively been succeeded by the LG V40, the G7's lower price and high-end specs help it win out.The phone packs a powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset, giving it about as much horsepower as you could need. With 6.1 inches of high-resolutionOLEDdisplay, it's definitely pretty where it counts and gets extra bright, helping visibility in direct sunlight. It's all rounded out by an glass front and back with a notched display; Overall, the design is uninspired, but serviceable.While LG's AI features are neat in theory, it's really the flexibility offered by the wide-angle camera on the back that helps the device stand out. On the media side, the LG G7 has surprisingly  powerful speakers if you like to listen to music or podcasts directly from your smartphone.Read ourLG G7 ThinQ reviewToday's best LG G7 ThinQ deals£95£84ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)3. LG V40 ThinQStill a premium choiceOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:Q3 2018Weight:169gDimensions:158.8 x 75.7 x 7.6 mmOS:Android 8.1Screen size:6.4-inchResolution:1440 x 3120CPU:Snapdragon 845RAM:6GBStorage:64/128GBBattery:3,300mAhRear camera:12MP + 12MP + 16MPFront camera:8MP + 5MPReasons to buy+Five cameras+Light yet solid build+Beautiful displayReasons to avoid-Small battery-Too expensiveThe LG V40 ThinQ is to the G7 what the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is to the Galaxy S9: a  similar yet bigger and slightly higher-spec sibling. The V40 has a 6.4-inch OLED display that's both sharp and ready to display HDR10 content. On top of that, the phone features a versatile five-camera system with three on the rear and two on the front, even adding in HDR10 video recording.Unsurprisingly, the LG V40 also runs on a Snapdragon 845 chipset, but comes with 6BG of RAM by default. The notched display is another feature it shares with the LG G7.Audiophiles can enjoy the 32-Bit Quad DAC built in and the support for DTS:X surround sound. If you're adventurous, the phone's IP68 rating against water and dust along with its MIL-STD-810G shock resistance are reassuring, so you don't have to worry as much about damaging your investment while out and about.Read ourLG V40 ThinQ review(Image credit: LG)4. LG VelvetA reinvented lookOur expert review:Average Amazon review:☆☆☆☆☆SpecificationsRelease date:May 2020Weight:180gDimensions:167.2 x 74.1 x 7.9 mmOS:Android 10Screen size:6.8-inchResolution:1080 x 2460CPU:Snapdragon 765/765GRAM:6/8GBStorage:128GBBattery:4,300mAhRear camera:48MP + 8MP + 5MPFront camera:16MPToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Superb design+Solid performanceReasons to avoid-Underwhelming cameras-No Quad-DACThe Velvet is LG admitting its design had become a little stale, and so the company has delivered an attractive device with curved edges that make it seem slimmer even though the screen is the same size as the V60’s.The phone has the Snapdragon 765 in Korea and the 765G in the US (both support 5G) but as ever with LG, it’s frustratingly difficult to get the phone in other countries so you might have to import. That’s a shame because there’s a lot to like here with solid performance, an improved software skin and a headphone jack, even though it lacks the Quad DAC of other LG phones so the sound quality isn’t quite as good.Cameras are the phone’s downside, with noticeably iffy results from all lenses. The main sensor just about holds it together but the digital zoom is not great, and the ultrawide isn’t as good as we've come to expect from LG, the company who popularised the lens on phones.Read ourLG Velvet reviewToday's best LG Velvet deals52 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)5.

It has a front screen that swivels horizontally and upwards to reveal a smaller display underneath. That means more screen real estate while still being something you can hold with one hand.It doesn't quite succeed as its accompanying multi-screen software is pretty basic but the potential is certainly there. Elsewhere, it has decent hardware under the hood so it can cope with what you throw at it.Just a shame there's no telephoto camera and the phone doesn't quite live up to its ambitious beginnings.Read our fullLG Wing 5G review.(Image credit: LG)6. LG G8 ThinQLG's smartphone with air gestures and Hand IDOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:April 2019Weight:167gDimensions:151.9 x 71.8 x 8.4 mmOS:Android 9Screen size:6.1-inchResolution:1440 x 3120CPU:Snapdragon 855RAM:6GBStorage:128GBBattery:3,500mAhRear camera:12MP + 16MP + 12MPFront camera:8MPToday's Best DealsCheck AmazonReasons to buy+Hole-less vibrating top speaker+Vibrant OLED screenReasons to avoid-Hand ID tech is done in vein-Rather expensiveThe LG G8 ThinQ was LG's attempt at a 'futuristic' phone – it has Hand ID that scans the veins in your hand to open the phone, and gestures that let you navigate the device just by waving your hand through the air above the phone.Not all of these work perfectly though, and so the LG G8 ThinQ doesn't exactly fill all its promises.But the handset still has some great features, like a cutting-edge chipset and a vibrating screen that functions as a speaker, so you can do a lot worse than it.Read our full review:LG G8 ThinQToday's best LG G8 ThinQ dealsNo price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)7. LG V50 ThinQ 5GLG's first 5G phoneOur expert review:SpecificationsRelease date:May 2019Weight:183gDimensions:159.2 x 76.1 x 8.3 mmOS:Android 9Screen size:6.4-inchResolution:1440 x 3120CPU:Snapdragon 855RAM:6GBStorage:128GBBattery:4,000mAhRear camera:12MP + 12MP + 16MPFront camera:8MP + 5MPToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(128GB)Reasons to buy+Bright, sharp display+Variety of camerasReasons to avoid-Dated design-Unjustified priceLG's first 5G phone, the LG V50 ThinQ 5G, is... well... it's the LV V40, but with 5G connection, really. There are a few spec upgrades here and there, and it's got all the dual-screen functionality that the previous phone had, but it's definitely a very similar device.So why is the LG V50 ThinQ 5G lower on this list than the V40? That's because it's being sold at a much higher price, which makes recommending it a tricky affair. It's even more expensive than certain 5G phones, when it perhaps doesn't justify it.Saying that, it's still an impressive device in a few ways, especially if you're a fan of the dual-screen set-up, so it'll be a useful device for certain people. And if you're an LG fan who needs 5G connection, it's your only option.Read ourLG V50 ThinQ 5G reviewToday's best LG V50 ThinQ 5G deals£179.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)8.

But unlike the actual folding displays of the Samsung Galaxy Fold or Motorola Razr, the G8 is a normal smartphone that ships with a clip-on second screen case.This means it’s best for viewing two apps side by side, or turning the unit landscape to use as a controlpad for mobile gaming.It’s not a smartphone design that many people are crying out for and it is quite niche, but with a Snapdragon 855 and double the screens, for the price the G8X might be the LG phone for you.Read our fullLG G8X ThinQ review.Today's best LG G8X ThinQ deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesThese are thebest smartphonesCheck out ourLG promo codesto get the best deal on your next purchase.Round up of today's best dealsLG LG G7 ThinQ£95£84ViewSee all pricesLG Wing£829£449ViewSee all pricesLG V50 ThinQ 5G£179.99ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered byGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to theTerms & ConditionsandPrivacy Policyand are aged 16 or over.Alex Walker-ToddSocial Links NavigationSenior Phones EditorAlex joined as TechRadar's Senior Phones Editor in June 2022, but brings over a decade's worth of experience to the role, with an expertise in smartphones, tablets and wearables.

There are a few spec upgrades here and there, and it's got all the dual-screen functionality that the previous phone had, but it's definitely a very similar device.So why is the LG V50 ThinQ 5G lower on this list than the V40? That's because it's being sold at a much higher price, which makes recommending it a tricky affair. It's even more expensive than certain 5G phones, when it perhaps doesn't justify it.Saying that, it's still an impressive device in a few ways, especially if you're a fan of the dual-screen set-up, so it'll be a useful device for certain people. And if you're an LG fan who needs 5G connection, it's your only option.Read ourLG V50 ThinQ 5G reviewToday's best LG V50 ThinQ 5G deals£179.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)8.

The main sensor just about holds it together but the digital zoom is not great, and the ultrawide isn’t as good as we've come to expect from LG, the company who popularised the lens on phones.Read ourLG Velvet reviewToday's best LG Velvet deals52 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)5.

That means more screen real estate while still being something you can hold with one hand.It doesn't quite succeed as its accompanying multi-screen software is pretty basic but the potential is certainly there.

There are a few spec upgrades here and there, and it's got all the dual-screen functionality that the previous phone had, but it's definitely a very similar device.So why is the LG V50 ThinQ 5G lower on this list than the V40? That's because it's being sold at a much higher price, which makes recommending it a tricky affair. It's even more expensive than certain 5G phones, when it perhaps doesn't justify it.Saying that, it's still an impressive device in a few ways, especially if you're a fan of the dual-screen set-up, so it'll be a useful device for certain people. And if you're an LG fan who needs 5G connection, it's your only option.Read ourLG V50 ThinQ 5G reviewToday's best LG V50 ThinQ 5G deals£179.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)8.

The main sensor just about holds it together but the digital zoom is not great, and the ultrawide isn’t as good as we've come to expect from LG, the company who popularised the lens on phones.Read ourLG Velvet reviewToday's best LG Velvet deals52 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)5.

It has a front screen that swivels horizontally and upwards to reveal a smaller display underneath. That means more screen real estate while still being something you can hold with one hand.It doesn't quite succeed as its accompanying multi-screen software is pretty basic but the potential is certainly there. Elsewhere, it has decent hardware under the hood so it can cope with what you throw at it.Just a shame there's no telephoto camera and the phone doesn't quite live up to its ambitious beginnings.Read our fullLG Wing 5G review.(Image credit: LG)6.

There are a few spec upgrades here and there, and it's got all the dual-screen functionality that the previous phone had, but it's definitely a very similar device.So why is the LG V50 ThinQ 5G lower on this list than the V40? That's because it's being sold at a much higher price, which makes recommending it a tricky affair. It's even more expensive than certain 5G phones, when it perhaps doesn't justify it.Saying that, it's still an impressive device in a few ways, especially if you're a fan of the dual-screen set-up, so it'll be a useful device for certain people. And if you're an LG fan who needs 5G connection, it's your only option.Read ourLG V50 ThinQ 5G reviewToday's best LG V50 ThinQ 5G deals£179.99ViewWe check over 250 million products every day for the best prices(Image credit: LG)8.

But unlike the actual folding displays of the Samsung Galaxy Fold or Motorola Razr, the G8 is a normal smartphone that ships with a clip-on second screen case.This means it’s best for viewing two apps side by side, or turning the unit landscape to use as a controlpad for mobile gaming.It’s not a smartphone design that many people are crying out for and it is quite niche, but with a Snapdragon 855 and double the screens, for the price the G8X might be the LG phone for you.Read our fullLG G8X ThinQ review.Today's best LG G8X ThinQ deals8 Amazon customer reviews☆☆☆☆☆No price informationCheck AmazonWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesThese are thebest smartphonesCheck out ourLG promo codesto get the best deal on your next purchase.Round up of today's best dealsLG LG G7 ThinQ£95£84ViewSee all pricesLG Wing£829£449ViewSee all pricesLG V50 ThinQ 5G£179.99ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by LGhasquit the smartphone businessso this guide to the best LG phones won't see any new additions or changes to its rankings.

It has a big, bright display that looks great, although it only has a 60Hz refresh rate - normal for most phones, but similar spec flagships like the OnePlus 8 Pro andSamsungGalaxy S20 have 120Hz, making them more fluid looking.  The V60 excels in battery life with a genuine two day battery life, top performance from the Snapdragon 865 chip and 5G compatibility. Most purchases also come with the Dual Screen case. It’s bulky, but adds a second screen so you can run two apps side by side or use it as a Nintendo 3DS-style game pad. With a Quad-DAC headphone jack and superb video controls for the dual cameras, the LG V60 is a content creator’s ideal smartphone. Read ourLG V60 ThinQ 5G review.

Although it has effectively been succeeded by the LG V40, the G7's lower price and high-end specs help it win out. The phone packs a powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset, giving it about as much horsepower as you could need. With 6.1 inches of high-resolutionOLEDdisplay, it's definitely pretty where it counts and gets extra bright, helping visibility in direct sunlight. It's all rounded out by an glass front and back with a notched display; Overall, the design is uninspired, but serviceable. While LG's AI features are neat in theory, it's really the flexibility offered by the wide-angle camera on the back that helps the device stand out. On the media side, the LG G7 has surprisingly  powerful speakers if you like to listen to music or podcasts directly from your smartphone.

The V40 has a 6.4-inch OLED display that's both sharp and ready to display HDR10 content. On top of that, the phone features a versatile five-camera system with three on the rear and two on the front, even adding in HDR10 video recording. Unsurprisingly, the LG V40 also runs on a Snapdragon 845 chipset, but comes with 6BG of RAM by default. The notched display is another feature it shares with the LG G7. Audiophiles can enjoy the 32-Bit Quad DAC built in and the support for DTS:X surround sound. If you're adventurous, the phone's IP68 rating against water and dust along with its MIL-STD-810G shock resistance are reassuring, so you don't have to worry as much about damaging your investment while out and about.

Not all of these work perfectly though, and so the LG G8 ThinQ doesn't exactly fill all its promises. But the handset still has some great features, like a cutting-edge chipset and a vibrating screen that functions as a speaker, so you can do a lot worse than it.

There are a few spec upgrades here and there, and it's got all the dual-screen functionality that the previous phone had, but it's definitely a very similar device. So why is the LG V50 ThinQ 5G lower on this list than the V40? That's because it's being sold at a much higher price, which makes recommending it a tricky affair. It's even more expensive than certain 5G phones, when it perhaps doesn't justify it. Saying that, it's still an impressive device in a few ways, especially if you're a fan of the dual-screen set-up, so it'll be a useful device for certain people. And if you're an LG fan who needs 5G connection, it's your only option.

But unlike the actual folding displays of the Samsung Galaxy Fold or Motorola Razr, the G8 is a normal smartphone that ships with a clip-on second screen case. This means it’s best for viewing two apps side by side, or turning the unit landscape to use as a controlpad for mobile gaming. It’s not a smartphone design that many people are crying out for and it is quite niche, but with a Snapdragon 855 and double the screens, for the price the G8X might be the LG phone for you.

The company plans to expand this number to 300 million within the next three years and has also diversified the application of webOS into projectors, digital signage, and in-vehicle infotainment systems.LG's commitment to constant innovation based on consumer insights sets it apart. It has made investments in advertising and content data analysis to fortify the webOS ecosystem. LG is also focusing on enhancing content variety, refining user interfaces, and consolidating global partnerships with content producers.In the ever-evolving world of technology, companies must adapt to thrive. Once a key player in the mobile sector, LG Electronics is charting a bold new direction: pivoting to become a prominent media and entertainment platform company.Recall that LG, an original member of the Open Handset Alliance which paved the way for Android, officiallyexited the smartphone market in 2021. However, rather than signaling a decline, this move has been followed by a period of growth. After the mobile division's closure,LG reported increased profits last year. It seems the South Korean giant was recalibrating its strategy.LG unveiled its new visionat the webOS Partner Summit 2023 in Seoul, attended by a global consortium of content creators, developers, and industry leaders (viaSamMobile). The company's aim? To enrich consumers' lives with an array of services and curated content, especially on flagship products like LG OLED and LG QNED TVs.Central to this mission is LG's webOS, a smart TV platform. Launched on LG Smart TVs in 2014 after originally powering Palm Phones, it's become one of the most prevalent platforms of its kind globally. Impressively, it powers over 200 million LG TVs and supports various third-party brands. With an aggressive expansion strategy, LG aims to elevate this figure to 300 million within the next three years. Furthermore, LG has diversified the application of webOS into projectors, digital signage, and in-vehicle infotainment systems.LG's webOS could soon power more than just smart TVs.The webOS Hub, catering to third-party brands, has seen remarkable growth, with partner brands rising from 20 to over 300 in just two years. This evolution brings with it a slew of features, ranging from cloud gaming to OTT services, further enhancing user experience.But what sets LG apart is its commitment to constant innovation based on profound consumer insights. The company has made it possible for users to enjoy the latest webOS versions on their home TVs, offering robust support for operating system upgrades even for previous TV models.Moreover, to fortify the webOS ecosystem, LG acquired a majority stake in US-based Alphonso in 2021, specializing in advertising and content data analysis. This aligns with LG's pledge to invest a hefty KRW 1 trillion in its webOS business over the next five years, aiming to cater to diverse consumer lifestyles and preferences. LG's investment will focus on enhancing content variety, refining user interfaces, and consolidating global partnerships with content producers.On the technological forefront, LG is emphasizing innovation in AI-based search and recommendations, with plans to incorporate a Voice User Interface feature. This will allow webOS users to smoothly control and explore third-party content services using voice commands, simplifying content discovery.With such ambitious plans, one might ponder the impact on competitors like Samsung.

The company plans to expand this number to 300 million within the next three years and has also diversified the application of webOS into projectors, digital signage, and in-vehicle infotainment systems.LG's commitment to constant innovation based on consumer insights sets it apart. It has made investments in advertising and content data analysis to fortify the webOS ecosystem. LG is also focusing on enhancing content variety, refining user interfaces, and consolidating global partnerships with content producers.In the ever-evolving world of technology, companies must adapt to thrive. Once a key player in the mobile sector, LG Electronics is charting a bold new direction: pivoting to become a prominent media and entertainment platform company.Recall that LG, an original member of the Open Handset Alliance which paved the way for Android, officiallyexited the smartphone market in 2021. However, rather than signaling a decline, this move has been followed by a period of growth. After the mobile division's closure,LG reported increased profits last year. It seems the South Korean giant was recalibrating its strategy.LG unveiled its new visionat the webOS Partner Summit 2023 in Seoul, attended by a global consortium of content creators, developers, and industry leaders (viaSamMobile). The company's aim? To enrich consumers' lives with an array of services and curated content, especially on flagship products like LG OLED and LG QNED TVs.Central to this mission is LG's webOS, a smart TV platform. Launched on LG Smart TVs in 2014 after originally powering Palm Phones, it's become one of the most prevalent platforms of its kind globally. Impressively, it powers over 200 million LG TVs and supports various third-party brands. With an aggressive expansion strategy, LG aims to elevate this figure to 300 million within the next three years. Furthermore, LG has diversified the application of webOS into projectors, digital signage, and in-vehicle infotainment systems.LG's webOS could soon power more than just smart TVs.The webOS Hub, catering to third-party brands, has seen remarkable growth, with partner brands rising from 20 to over 300 in just two years. This evolution brings with it a slew of features, ranging from cloud gaming to OTT services, further enhancing user experience.But what sets LG apart is its commitment to constant innovation based on profound consumer insights. The company has made it possible for users to enjoy the latest webOS versions on their home TVs, offering robust support for operating system upgrades even for previous TV models.Moreover, to fortify the webOS ecosystem, LG acquired a majority stake in US-based Alphonso in 2021, specializing in advertising and content data analysis. This aligns with LG's pledge to invest a hefty KRW 1 trillion in its webOS business over the next five years, aiming to cater to diverse consumer lifestyles and preferences. LG's investment will focus on enhancing content variety, refining user interfaces, and consolidating global partnerships with content producers.On the technological forefront, LG is emphasizing innovation in AI-based search and recommendations, with plans to incorporate a Voice User Interface feature. This will allow webOS users to smoothly control and explore third-party content services using voice commands, simplifying content discovery.With such ambitious plans, one might ponder the impact on competitors like Samsung. As SamMobile pointed out, while LG's emphasis on evolving the webOS platform and prioritizing its OLED and QNED TVs hints at a refined focus, it might translate into Samsung capturing more of the consumer electronics market share with less pressure from its biggest domestic rival.

In astatementpublished on Monday, the South Korean company explained that its exit from the “incredibly competitive mobile phone sector” would allow it to “focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services.”In recent years, the former smartphone trailblazer – LG even preceded the iPhone with its first touchscreen phone, the LG Prada, in 2006 – had been relegated to an also-ran in the increasingly competitive smartphone industry. With Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi quickly gaining popularity outside of their home market, LG saw its market share slip to low single digits globally. According to estimates fromCounterpoint Research, the company shipped 24.7 million devices in 2020, which is equivalent to a market share of just 1.9 percent.Felix RichterData Journalistfelix.richter@statista.com+49 (40) 284 841 557DescriptionThis chart ranks the world's largest smartphone brands based on their share of global shipments in 2020.ReportDownload ChartURL to be used asreference link:https://www.statista.com/chart/24569/global-smartphone-market-share/HTML code to embed chartCan I integrate infographics into my blog or website?Yes, Statista allows the easy integration of many infographics on other websites.

In astatementpublished on Monday, the South Korean company explained that its exit from the “incredibly competitive mobile phone sector” would allow it to “focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services.”In recent years, the former smartphone trailblazer – LG even preceded the iPhone with its first touchscreen phone, the LG Prada, in 2006 – had been relegated to an also-ran in the increasingly competitive smartphone industry. With Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi quickly gaining popularity outside of their home market, LG saw its market share slip to low single digits globally. According to estimates fromCounterpoint Research, the company shipped 24.7 million devices in 2020, which is equivalent to a market share of just 1.9 percent.Felix RichterData Journalistfelix.richter@statista.com+49 (40) 284 841 557DescriptionThis chart ranks the world's largest smartphone brands based on their share of global shipments in 2020.ReportDownload ChartURL to be used asreference link:https://www.statista.com/chart/24569/global-smartphone-market-share/HTML code to embed chartCan I integrate infographics into my blog or website?Yes, Statista allows the easy integration of many infographics on other websites.

Something to capture the smaller moments that are more personal to me and go on social media, outside of the realm of ""work.""The LG G4, while after my investigation is not a replacement for my DSLR, does an acceptable job at fulfilling the ""always ready"" camera role.Technical SpecificationsHardwareThe G4 contains a larger-than-average 1/2.6"" 16 Megapixel sensor paired with an f/1.8 lens. It focuses with what LG calls ""laser"" autofocus and also includes a sensor specifically to help with white balance.SoftwareA nice change from many other cellphone cameras, the G4 has a host of manual controls.The LG G4 manual controls are an excellent addition to cell phone cameras.Some of the handy features include being able to shoot in RAW+JPG formats, a digital level, and focus points (although the phone is capable of focusing anywhere on the screen).LG G4 vs Nikon D750The sales associate who sold me the G4 noted several times that it was ""as good as a DSLR.""I decided to take it out for a shoot and do a little comparisonBelow are two photos, guess which one was taken with the G4, and which one was my D750.If you guessed the second image was the G4, you were correct.Cell phones still have a very notable difference from DSLRs, you can't change the focal length.In most cases, this means little, but when it comes to photos like the head-shots above, distortion comes into play.Cell phones aren't going to truly compete with DSLRs for awhile, but the LG G4 is still a great camera to have for those smaller moments.Here are a couple more examples of the G4's photo abilities. It really tends to shine in macro-style photos.Want more reviews?

It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 othersThomas savageGrand ContributorThe WatchmanForum DonorJoinedFeb 24, 2016Messages10,260Likes16,345Locationuk, tauntonSep 9, 2018#2Great stuff, thanks amir.independence, we do it together..https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereviewReactions:VeriandLuckyLuke575JJJB70Major ContributorForum DonorJoinedAug 17, 2018Messages2,905Likes6,179LocationSingaporeSep 9, 2018#3This is the elephant in the room for the audio industry and the whole associated magazine and website media chain - smart phones nowadays tend to have very good DA audio conversion. Magazines and audio equipment manufacturers still peddle the idea that smart phones have 2 cent audio set ups and only a deaf person could possibly enjoy the output. I think many have been clinging to the idea so long that they probably believe it. My own phone is a Sony XZ premium and I say in complete honesty that I really struggle to discern any difference if using an outboard DAC, even a high end one. The on-board amplifiers are a different story, not because of poor sound but they do tend to be a bit anaemic. So a separate amplifier can be an excellent investment. I keep talking to people who believed magazines and certain websites and complain because the sound is just the same. The response from audiophiles is that these people are deaf, but I think that the reality is that there is much less reason to buy a separate DAC than some parties want us to believe.I used to fly, but I go the modern way now, by bus.Reactions:bobbooo,shorewalker,BogdanRand 5 othersέχω δίκιοActive MemberJoinedApr 20, 2018Messages249Likes282Sep 9, 2018#4Thank you Amir!

It's a shame that Apple has taken such a step backwards with their current iPhones, with all omitting the line output that used to be available on the 30 pin dock connector and most omitting a headphone jack.

However, sometimes you get an anemic, noise ridden audio output like the Nexus 6P, which can barely drive a pair of earbuds, let alone IEMs or anything serious. It was all but necessary for me to buy an external amplifier when I had that phone. Even so, we see that they are still hesitant to give the end user any real power output (probably to save battery, because most people would care more about that).έχω δίκιο said:Apple is so proud of being able to route various signals through the lightning connector, but not making analog L+R audio part of their standard was a huge mistake.Click to expand...I am incredibly curious to see one of these lightning adapters measured. There's a lot of micro circuitry inside.EDIT: There was anifixit article that went over ita while ago.“…we falsely believe that the mind of everyone we interact with is like our own in its elements and rules, but not in its detailed contents” (Daly & Wilson 1997.)maxxevvMajor ContributorJoinedApr 12, 2018Messages1,873Likes1,970Sep 9, 2018#7I have the LG G6, there is a way to induce it into ""External Device"" mode which is more or less ""line-out"". It will somehow enable a higher amping in the circuitry and my HE4XX in that mode will play as loud as my HD6XX does in ""High Impedance"" mode though the volume settings are a little different in these 2 different modes. It essentially disregards the headphone input impedance values.To do to that, I assume you are plugging a 3.5mm jack to RCA splitter into the phone ?i) Plug that connector into the handphone jack first, leaving the other end open.ii) Start the LG music player. You should see the ""External Device"" mode.iii)From there, then plug the other end of connector to the output device.I suspect you will get a different reading from the results you have gotten so far.Edit:To add, UAPP and other ""bit perfect"" Android music players such as Onkyo and Hiby are more for connecting to external DAC's via USB from the phone and circumvent the 16-bit limitation.Reactions:WagstaffOPamirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018Thread Starter#8έχω δίκιο said:Thank you Amir!

Fortunately someone gave me one of those dongles (I think it is from Google for pixel) so I plan to test that.But yes, it is a bummer which Apple chose to disadvantage one of the most common scenarios on a phone: listening to music.I suspect the superficial excuse is to make the units thinner.  But then they make them so fragile that you have to put a case around them!  So much for them being thin.  I never used a case with my phones until I got the Samsung S8+ with its glass back.

He is out over $300 replacing a cracked screen and back on his phone.  He now uses a case...  I really liked the phone, but thought the glass made it really slippery.  Same complaint with my Essential PH-1 - the ceramic back is really slippery and a fingerprint magnet.  Hence the $10 rubber case that makes the cool ceramic back unseen.WWondrousHippoActive MemberForum DonorJoinedMar 22, 2018Messages169Likes118Sep 9, 2018#10I have the LG V20 with the same chip (minus MQA support) so I'm glad to hear LG's delivering on performance that matches my subjective impressions.@amirmdid you have the UAPP Internal Audio Driver setting set to HiRes Direct Driver as well?AttachmentsScreenshot_2018-09-09-12-20-34.png169.4 KB

Nothing would work other than that MQA setting.  The app needs to have better diagnostics as to whether the options selected do something.

On my Samsung S8+, the pop up comes up and you have to say OK before it lets you turn up the volume further.It is a very stupid thing because it is in play when I am streaming using bluetooth to my car stereo.  There, the default levels are way too anemic and I have to turn it up to max and while driving, the stupid pop up shows up.  It would take so little code to ask/detect if you are streaming to a car stereo versus headphones.AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Rottmannashandvito45OPamirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018Thread Starter#15Sal1950 said:I can only imagine the feeling in the pit of my stomach if I dropped one of these down a full flight of moving steel stairways.I did this at Orlando Int with my free LG TracFone flip phone.

It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 othersThomas savageGrand ContributorThe WatchmanForum DonorJoinedFeb 24, 2016Messages10,260Likes16,345Locationuk, tauntonSep 9, 2018#2Great stuff, thanks amir.independence, we do it together..https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereviewReactions:VeriandLuckyLuke575JJJB70Major ContributorForum DonorJoinedAug 17, 2018Messages2,905Likes6,179LocationSingaporeSep 9, 2018#3This is the elephant in the room for the audio industry and the whole associated magazine and website media chain - smart phones nowadays tend to have very good DA audio conversion.

The on-board amplifiers are a different story, not because of poor sound but they do tend to be a bit anaemic. So a separate amplifier can be an excellent investment.

It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.

Review and Audio Measurement of LG G7 ThinQ SmartphoneThread starteramirmStart dateSep 9, 2018 Review and Audio Measurement of LG G7 ThinQ Smartphone Review and Audio Measurement of LG G7 ThinQ Smartphone Thread starteramirmStart dateSep 9, 2018 Thread starteramirm Thread starter amirm Start dateSep 9, 2018 Start date 123…Go to pageGo18Next1 of 18Go to pageGoNextLastamirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018#1This is the review and measurements of the audio performance of LG G7 ThinQ smartphone.  It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 othersThomas savageGrand ContributorThe WatchmanForum DonorJoinedFeb 24, 2016Messages10,260Likes16,345Locationuk, tauntonSep 9, 2018#2Great stuff, thanks amir.independence, we do it together..https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereviewReactions:VeriandLuckyLuke575JJJB70Major ContributorForum DonorJoinedAug 17, 2018Messages2,905Likes6,179LocationSingaporeSep 9, 2018#3This is the elephant in the room for the audio industry and the whole associated magazine and website media chain - smart phones nowadays tend to have very good DA audio conversion. Magazines and audio equipment manufacturers still peddle the idea that smart phones have 2 cent audio set ups and only a deaf person could possibly enjoy the output. I think many have been clinging to the idea so long that they probably believe it. My own phone is a Sony XZ premium and I say in complete honesty that I really struggle to discern any difference if using an outboard DAC, even a high end one. The on-board amplifiers are a different story, not because of poor sound but they do tend to be a bit anaemic. So a separate amplifier can be an excellent investment. I keep talking to people who believed magazines and certain websites and complain because the sound is just the same. The response from audiophiles is that these people are deaf, but I think that the reality is that there is much less reason to buy a separate DAC than some parties want us to believe.I used to fly, but I go the modern way now, by bus.Reactions:bobbooo,shorewalker,BogdanRand 5 othersέχω δίκιοActive MemberJoinedApr 20, 2018Messages249Likes282Sep 9, 2018#4Thank you Amir!  That was quite interesting.  It's a shame that Apple has taken such a step backwards with their current iPhones, with all omitting the line output that used to be available on the 30 pin dock connector and most omitting a headphone jack.

However, sometimes you get an anemic, noise ridden audio output like the Nexus 6P, which can barely drive a pair of earbuds, let alone IEMs or anything serious. It was all but necessary for me to buy an external amplifier when I had that phone. Even so, we see that they are still hesitant to give the end user any real power output (probably to save battery, because most people would care more about that).έχω δίκιο said:Apple is so proud of being able to route various signals through the lightning connector, but not making analog L+R audio part of their standard was a huge mistake.Click to expand...I am incredibly curious to see one of these lightning adapters measured. There's a lot of micro circuitry inside.EDIT: There was anifixit article that went over ita while ago.“…we falsely believe that the mind of everyone we interact with is like our own in its elements and rules, but not in its detailed contents” (Daly & Wilson 1997.)maxxevvMajor ContributorJoinedApr 12, 2018Messages1,873Likes1,970Sep 9, 2018#7I have the LG G6, there is a way to induce it into ""External Device"" mode which is more or less ""line-out"". It will somehow enable a higher amping in the circuitry and my HE4XX in that mode will play as loud as my HD6XX does in ""High Impedance"" mode though the volume settings are a little different in these 2 different modes. It essentially disregards the headphone input impedance values.To do to that, I assume you are plugging a 3.5mm jack to RCA splitter into the phone ?i) Plug that connector into the handphone jack first, leaving the other end open.ii) Start the LG music player. You should see the ""External Device"" mode.iii)From there, then plug the other end of connector to the output device.I suspect you will get a different reading from the results you have gotten so far.Edit:To add, UAPP and other ""bit perfect"" Android music players such as Onkyo and Hiby are more for connecting to external DAC's via USB from the phone and circumvent the 16-bit limitation.Reactions:WagstaffOPamirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018Thread Starter#8έχω δίκιο said:Thank you Amir!

SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 othersThomas savageGrand ContributorThe WatchmanForum DonorJoinedFeb 24, 2016Messages10,260Likes16,345Locationuk, tauntonSep 9, 2018#2Great stuff, thanks amir.independence, we do it together..https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereviewReactions:VeriandLuckyLuke575JJJB70Major ContributorForum DonorJoinedAug 17, 2018Messages2,905Likes6,179LocationSingaporeSep 9, 2018#3This is the elephant in the room for the audio industry and the whole associated magazine and website media chain - smart phones nowadays tend to have very good DA audio conversion.

On my Samsung S8+, the pop up comes up and you have to say OK before it lets you turn up the volume further.It is a very stupid thing because it is in play when I am streaming using bluetooth to my car stereo.  There, the default levels are way too anemic and I have to turn it up to max and while driving, the stupid pop up shows up.

It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.

It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 othersThomas savageGrand ContributorThe WatchmanForum DonorJoinedFeb 24, 2016Messages10,260Likes16,345Locationuk, tauntonSep 9, 2018#2Great stuff, thanks amir.independence, we do it together..https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereviewReactions:VeriandLuckyLuke575JJJB70Major ContributorForum DonorJoinedAug 17, 2018Messages2,905Likes6,179LocationSingaporeSep 9, 2018#3This is the elephant in the room for the audio industry and the whole associated magazine and website media chain - smart phones nowadays tend to have very good DA audio conversion. Magazines and audio equipment manufacturers still peddle the idea that smart phones have 2 cent audio set ups and only a deaf person could possibly enjoy the output. I think many have been clinging to the idea so long that they probably believe it. My own phone is a Sony XZ premium and I say in complete honesty that I really struggle to discern any difference if using an outboard DAC, even a high end one. The on-board amplifiers are a different story, not because of poor sound but they do tend to be a bit anaemic. So a separate amplifier can be an excellent investment. I keep talking to people who believed magazines and certain websites and complain because the sound is just the same. The response from audiophiles is that these people are deaf, but I think that the reality is that there is much less reason to buy a separate DAC than some parties want us to believe.I used to fly, but I go the modern way now, by bus.Reactions:bobbooo,shorewalker,BogdanRand 5 othersέχω δίκιοActive MemberJoinedApr 20, 2018Messages249Likes282Sep 9, 2018#4Thank you Amir!

However, sometimes you get an anemic, noise ridden audio output like the Nexus 6P, which can barely drive a pair of earbuds, let alone IEMs or anything serious. It was all but necessary for me to buy an external amplifier when I had that phone. Even so, we see that they are still hesitant to give the end user any real power output (probably to save battery, because most people would care more about that).έχω δίκιο said:Apple is so proud of being able to route various signals through the lightning connector, but not making analog L+R audio part of their standard was a huge mistake.Click to expand...I am incredibly curious to see one of these lightning adapters measured. There's a lot of micro circuitry inside.EDIT: There was anifixit article that went over ita while ago.“…we falsely believe that the mind of everyone we interact with is like our own in its elements and rules, but not in its detailed contents” (Daly & Wilson 1997.)maxxevvMajor ContributorJoinedApr 12, 2018Messages1,873Likes1,970Sep 9, 2018#7I have the LG G6, there is a way to induce it into ""External Device"" mode which is more or less ""line-out"". It will somehow enable a higher amping in the circuitry and my HE4XX in that mode will play as loud as my HD6XX does in ""High Impedance"" mode though the volume settings are a little different in these 2 different modes. It essentially disregards the headphone input impedance values.To do to that, I assume you are plugging a 3.5mm jack to RCA splitter into the phone ?i) Plug that connector into the handphone jack first, leaving the other end open.ii) Start the LG music player. You should see the ""External Device"" mode.iii)From there, then plug the other end of connector to the output device.I suspect you will get a different reading from the results you have gotten so far.Edit:To add, UAPP and other ""bit perfect"" Android music players such as Onkyo and Hiby are more for connecting to external DAC's via USB from the phone and circumvent the 16-bit limitation.Reactions:WagstaffOPamirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018Thread Starter#8έχω δίκιο said:Thank you Amir!

We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 othersThomas savageGrand ContributorThe WatchmanForum DonorJoinedFeb 24, 2016Messages10,260Likes16,345Locationuk, tauntonSep 9, 2018#2Great stuff, thanks amir.independence, we do it together..https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereviewReactions:VeriandLuckyLuke575JJJB70Major ContributorForum DonorJoinedAug 17, 2018Messages2,905Likes6,179LocationSingaporeSep 9, 2018#3This is the elephant in the room for the audio industry and the whole associated magazine and website media chain - smart phones nowadays tend to have very good DA audio conversion.

It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.

On my Samsung S8+, the pop up comes up and you have to say OK before it lets you turn up the volume further.It is a very stupid thing because it is in play when I am streaming using bluetooth to my car stereo.  There, the default levels are way too anemic and I have to turn it up to max and while driving, the stupid pop up shows up.  It would take so little code to ask/detect if you are streaming to a car stereo versus headphones.AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Rottmannashandvito45OPamirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018Thread Starter#15Sal1950 said:I can only imagine the feeling in the pit of my stomach if I dropped one of these down a full flight of moving steel stairways.I did this at Orlando Int with my free LG TracFone flip phone.

To be honest, with efficient headphones I find it OK most of the time, I use my T5P headphones with it and the volume is actually pretty reasonable and with FLAC files or high quality lossy files the audio quality is excellent.I used to fly, but I go the modern way now, by bus.TtwgibNew MemberJoinedJun 15, 2018Messages3Likes0Sep 10, 2018#19Thank you for the review, but may I ask for recommendations of a similar product but maybe one that's a bit more budget friendly to acquire? There's so many used smartphones available (some that can be had very cheaply with bad IMEI) that are begging for use as sources in transportable audio stacks! It's just picking from all of what's out there! Some insight on what have good DAC's would be terrific!

It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.  Even its non-quad DAC produces class leading results.The weak point is the headphone amplifier which has a mind of its own and severely limits output power into small load impedances.   As such an external portable headphone amp would be necessary for proper performance for most headphones.  No need to augment it with a DAC though as the LG G7 DAC outperforms just about all the portable DACs.While I have only tested two modern smartphones so far, theLG G7 ThinQ easily gets my recommendation for its audio performance.Well done LG!-------------As always, questions, comments, recommendations, etc. are welcome.If you like this review, please consider donating funds to support these reviews using Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/audiosciencereview), or upgrading your membership here though Paypal (https://audiosciencereview.com/foru...eview-and-measurements.2164/page-3#post-59054).AmirFounder, Audio Science ReviewFounder, Madrona DigitalReview Thread RulesMy Technical BackgroundMy YouTube ChannelMy Audio Review TracklistsReactions:Nango,brimble,Rottmannashand 31 others  amirmFounder/AdminStaff MemberCFO (Chief Fun Officer)JoinedFeb 13, 2016Messages45,639Likes252,901LocationSeattle AreaSep 9, 2018#1This is the review and measurements of the audio performance of LG G7 ThinQ smartphone.

This is the review and measurements of the audio performance of LG G7 ThinQ smartphone.  It was purchased by my son a couple of weeks ago.  It retails for USD $750.  Its claim to fame is inclusion of an ESS quad (four paralleled) DACs ES9218P with integrated headphone amplifier.There are actually two DACs in there with Quad DAC by default not selected.I suspect they don't leave it as default because it uses more power and would hurt benchmarks and battery life.It even has fancy audiophile reconstruction filter choices:Default was ""short"" (apodizing) filter.  As seen above, we did our testing using Sharp filter.Is this all fluff or does it perform?  Let's find out.MeasurementsLet's start with our usual dashboard view of a 24-bit, 1 kHz tone at 44.1 kHz sampling:Wow, that is impressive.  SINAD (signal above power of noise+distortion) is in desktop DAC category:As shown above, the standard DAC is no slouch either, clocking at 105 dB in SINAD.Both leave my Samsung S8+ deep in the dust at just 89 dB...Dynamic Range (SNR) is pretty good with both DACs:The Standard DAC has lower output though:Just 0.8 volts output?  That is darn anemic but more on that later.In preparing for these measurements, I assumed that LG was not thoughtful enough to have its media player bypassing the Android audio stack. So we downloaded the USB Audio Pro player for $8 and gave that a try.  Performance was initially disappointing:No matter what we tried, we could not get better numbers.  Indeed none of the settings in the player made any difference!  Hearing that the LG G7 supports MQA, on a whim, we tried that option in the player:That did the trick:This shows that the Android audio pipeline is limited to 16 bits so best to avoid it if you can.  Fortunately the LG player does that and therefore, there is no need to buy USB Audio Pro (unless you like its interface better).All was not perfect here.  LG has some screwy logic where it examines the impedance of the headphone and messes with the output level and hence power.  This was not always consistent.  We managed to get outputs as high as 2 volts RMS but other times, it would step down to 1.5 or even 1 volt.  After a while, we managed to get consistent outputs resulting in these power numbers relative to load (just a volume step below clipping):As we see, the headphone amp does not like low impedances.  It sharply drops output voltage resulting in very low power outputs.  This is the opposite of external headphone amplifiers where lowering the load impedance increases their output power.Output impedance was a low 1.6 ohm:Channel balance was of course perfect due to digital volume control:Listening TestI did some brief testing with two of my headphones.  Using the HifiMan HE-400i, the output was very anemic.  Its 35 ohm impedance forces the headphone amp to clamp down resulting in too little power.  Switching to Sennheiser  HD-650 results in a far more satisfying experience given its 300 ohm output.  Mind you, it is not super loud but good.  My Etymotic ER4 SR produced decent levels too but still not loud enough.ConclusionsThe LG G7 ThinQ DAC produces exemplary performance.  It destroys the Samsung S8+.  I was impressed that they paired good playback software with the hardware to make sure the Android limitations of 16 bit audio don't get in the way.

TtwgibNew MemberJoinedJun 15, 2018Messages3Likes0Sep 10, 2018#19Thank you for the review, but may I ask for recommendations of a similar product but maybe one that's a bit more budget friendly to acquire? There's so many used smartphones available (some that can be had very cheaply with bad IMEI) that are begging for use as sources in transportable audio stacks!

I've waited this long, because I wanted to live with the G3 to decide if its many features live up to the hype.Since the G3 was first announced, I've been through a couple of different emotions over the styling. First of all, when I initially saw photos of it, I thought it looked great. Atthe launch event, when I got to use it for the first time, I was less sold. Early rumours had suggested that it would be a metal device, but in fact it's plastic. It felt, to me, a bit less well-built than the iPhone andHTCOne M8. Having actually used it for the past month, I have to say I really like the build quality.LG G3 from the rearFor me, plastic is something of an advantage, because it's a bit lighter. That doesn't matter for the iPhone because it's a smaller phone, but when you're looking at devices like the HTC One, it's big enough for that extra weight to make a difference. The G3 is larger than the One, and still lighter, so the body makes sense. Also, metal is a very expensive material to build phones from and doesn't make sense for a lot of manufacturers.One of the things that caused a ripple of excitement when the phone was announced were the Quick Circle cases. These are covers that protect the back of the phone with a hard cover, and the front with a softer material that has a circle cut into it. This allows the phone to display a clock and basic notifications. These cases are a nifty idea, like HTC's rather nice Dot View cover, but the LG version is a little more basic and while it does keep the phone protected, I haven't totally fallen in love with them.The Quick Circle caseLG also does other cases, there's a harder shell that replaces the back cover too and aims to protect the phone from drops and scrapes. Because the phone supports QI wireless charging, you need to make sure that the case supports that if you're planning to use it. I have the wireless charger, and it's really nifty and ideal for desk use when you want to keep your phone topped up during the work day.The biggest fuss, of course, was made about the LG's screen. It won me over based purely on spec, because it's an LCD - which I prefer to OLED - and it has an impressive resolution of 1440x2560. In practice the screen really is amazing. There's a clarity to it that really startling, and it goes well beyond the spec alone. It does make using the phone a really great experience, and it also makes it hard to go back to phones with lower resolutions. I've found browsing the web to especially benefit from the high resolution, and the phone is powerful enough to make scaling content slick and responsive too.Battery life is good, but having the wireless charger means you can keep the phone charged all the... [+]timeBattery life is another issue, and something I've battled with over the time I've had this phone. To be totally fair to LG, I think it has done a good job. The battery has to run a powerful processor, large screen with massive resolution and that's very challenging. With my heavy use, I can't usually get a full day on a single charge. LG also sent me the wireless charger too, and this makes a lot of sense for modern smartphones. Simply put it on your desk, and stand the phone at it while you work. That way, it's charged when you need it.Going out and about can be a problem of course, but even with heavy use I didn't have massive problems, the phone would be in need of charging early evening, but it would still get me through the day. I got into the habit of carrying an external battery a while ago too, so if it does need a top-up, I can provide one while I'm out.LG G3 menusSome features that I really like about the G3 aren't really that glamourous. But the included keyboard is excellent. I love the prediction, I find it amongst the most accurate I've used on a phone. Some tweaking of the settings will let you turn one the ""path input"" which is the Swype-style draw through letters option. You can also tweak the strength of the auto-correct too, which will be useful if you find it too aggressive. There are also options to update typing corrections from an online database. I've certainly felt no need to follow my own advice andreplace LG's keyboardwith a third-party one.I'm also a massive fan of LGHealth. It's much simpler than other phones options, but it happily tracks how far you walk each day and does so without any extra hardware. This is then presented in a graphically attractive way, and allows you to monitor how far you've walked on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can add in other activity too, but I like the simplicity of it.LG Health is a nice little app, and simple to useI like the idea of the split screen feature too. Press and hold the back button, and you can have selected apps running together on one screen. Say, a browser, and messaging. I haven't really found myself using it, but for chatting with friends while looking up directions online, it's a nice idea.The camera is also top-notch. A lot of fuss was made about the laser autofocus. I've found that to be as much of a mixed bag as with any phone's autofocus, but I think it's an improvement over other handsets. Samsung's cameras are pretty quick too though, so there's not as much in this as you might think. I really like the photos and video the G3 produces though, it's deeply impressive with images that have loads of colour and detail.The camera is impressive, although the laser autofocus isn't as amazing as one might hopeLG has made one slight error in the way it is selling the G3. There are basically two versions of the phone, which on the surface appear to be the usual storage options. You pick either 16 or 32GB, but there is a slightly more important difference, that of RAM. In the 16GB model you get 2GB of RAM, and in the 32GB there is 3GB. This is frustrating, as the microSD slot makes opting for the 32GB version less relevant, but the extra 1GB of RAM will make a huge performance difference. It's an odd decision, and I don't like it at all.I've also noticed that the G3 is very sensitive to headphone connection glitches. If you've used Android, you'll know this happens on some phones where moving the cable on the headphone can cause the phone to pause your music. This is annoying, and I've yet to find a solution to it. Also, I can't make the G3 work with a line-out cable in my car, which is the first time I've found that problem.The high-resolution screen is really impressiveIn my opinion, the G3 is the best Android phone in the world right now. It rivalsApple'siPhone for the best overall phone too, and the decision of which to get between Apple's flagship and the G3 will likely come down to which company you'd rather spend money with, or which operating system you're most comfortable with.For me, the LG G3 is perfect, although some might find that they miss features that Samsung has, like the fingerprint scanner and dedicated heart rate monitor. I also predict that Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 will give a run for its money in a few months time, but for me, the G3 is a better phone than anything currently on the market. Of course, it was introduced after everything else, so it's natural it has that as an advantage. It's reasonable to predict that Apple's iPhone 6 and Samsung's upcoming handsets will snap at its heels.  For now though, it's king of the hill.If you haveany questionsabout the G3, or my review, please add a comment below and I'll do my very best to answer.Follow me onLinkedIn.Ian MorrisEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades Subscribe To Newsletters Subscribe To Newsletters   Subscribe To Newsletters Subscribe To Newsletters     BETATHIS IS A BETA EXPERIENCE.

It won me over based purely on spec, because it's an LCD - which I prefer to OLED - and it has an impressive resolution of 1440x2560. In practice the screen really is amazing. There's a clarity to it that really startling, and it goes well beyond the spec alone. It does make using the phone a really great experience, and it also makes it hard to go back to phones with lower resolutions.

[+]timeBattery life is another issue, and something I've battled with over the time I've had this phone. To be totally fair to LG, I think it has done a good job. The battery has to run a powerful processor, large screen with massive resolution and that's very challenging. With my heavy use, I can't usually get a full day on a single charge. LG also sent me the wireless charger too, and this makes a lot of sense for modern smartphones. Simply put it on your desk, and stand the phone at it while you work. That way, it's charged when you need it.Going out and about can be a problem of course, but even with heavy use I didn't have massive problems, the phone would be in need of charging early evening, but it would still get me through the day. I got into the habit of carrying an external battery a while ago too, so if it does need a top-up, I can provide one while I'm out.LG G3 menusSome features that I really like about the G3 aren't really that glamourous. But the included keyboard is excellent. I love the prediction, I find it amongst the most accurate I've used on a phone. Some tweaking of the settings will let you turn one the ""path input"" which is the Swype-style draw through letters option. You can also tweak the strength of the auto-correct too, which will be useful if you find it too aggressive. There are also options to update typing corrections from an online database. I've certainly felt no need to follow my own advice andreplace LG's keyboardwith a third-party one.I'm also a massive fan of LGHealth. It's much simpler than other phones options, but it happily tracks how far you walk each day and does so without any extra hardware. This is then presented in a graphically attractive way, and allows you to monitor how far you've walked on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can add in other activity too, but I like the simplicity of it.LG Health is a nice little app, and simple to useI like the idea of the split screen feature too. Press and hold the back button, and you can have selected apps running together on one screen. Say, a browser, and messaging. I haven't really found myself using it, but for chatting with friends while looking up directions online, it's a nice idea.The camera is also top-notch. A lot of fuss was made about the laser autofocus. I've found that to be as much of a mixed bag as with any phone's autofocus, but I think it's an improvement over other handsets. Samsung's cameras are pretty quick too though, so there's not as much in this as you might think. I really like the photos and video the G3 produces though, it's deeply impressive with images that have loads of colour and detail.The camera is impressive, although the laser autofocus isn't as amazing as one might hopeLG has made one slight error in the way it is selling the G3. There are basically two versions of the phone, which on the surface appear to be the usual storage options. You pick either 16 or 32GB, but there is a slightly more important difference, that of RAM. In the 16GB model you get 2GB of RAM, and in the 32GB there is 3GB. This is frustrating, as the microSD slot makes opting for the 32GB version less relevant, but the extra 1GB of RAM will make a huge performance difference. It's an odd decision, and I don't like it at all.I've also noticed that the G3 is very sensitive to headphone connection glitches. If you've used Android, you'll know this happens on some phones where moving the cable on the headphone can cause the phone to pause your music. This is annoying, and I've yet to find a solution to it. Also, I can't make the G3 work with a line-out cable in my car, which is the first time I've found that problem.The high-resolution screen is really impressiveIn my opinion, the G3 is the best Android phone in the world right now. It rivalsApple'siPhone for the best overall phone too, and the decision of which to get between Apple's flagship and the G3 will likely come down to which company you'd rather spend money with, or which operating system you're most comfortable with.For me, the LG G3 is perfect, although some might find that they miss features that Samsung has, like the fingerprint scanner and dedicated heart rate monitor. I also predict that Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 will give a run for its money in a few months time, but for me, the G3 is a better phone than anything currently on the market. Of course, it was introduced after everything else, so it's natural it has that as an advantage. It's reasonable to predict that Apple's iPhone 6 and Samsung's upcoming handsets will snap at its heels.  For now though, it's king of the hill.If you haveany questionsabout the G3, or my review, please add a comment below and I'll do my very best to answer.Follow me onLinkedIn.Ian MorrisEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades  ForbesInnovationConsumer TechLG G3 Review: The Perfect SmartphoneIan MorrisFormer ContributorOpinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.Jul 11, 2014,02:29pm EDTUpdated Jul 13, 2014, 03:26am EDTThis article is more than 10 years old.Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinI've had the LG G3 for a month now and I want to point this out because most reviews - including many of the ones I write - are penned after significantly less time using a handset. I've waited this long, because I wanted to live with the G3 to decide if its many features live up to the hype.Since the G3 was first announced, I've been through a couple of different emotions over the styling. First of all, when I initially saw photos of it, I thought it looked great. Atthe launch event, when I got to use it for the first time, I was less sold. Early rumours had suggested that it would be a metal device, but in fact it's plastic. It felt, to me, a bit less well-built than the iPhone andHTCOne M8. Having actually used it for the past month, I have to say I really like the build quality.LG G3 from the rearFor me, plastic is something of an advantage, because it's a bit lighter. That doesn't matter for the iPhone because it's a smaller phone, but when you're looking at devices like the HTC One, it's big enough for that extra weight to make a difference. The G3 is larger than the One, and still lighter, so the body makes sense. Also, metal is a very expensive material to build phones from and doesn't make sense for a lot of manufacturers.One of the things that caused a ripple of excitement when the phone was announced were the Quick Circle cases. These are covers that protect the back of the phone with a hard cover, and the front with a softer material that has a circle cut into it. This allows the phone to display a clock and basic notifications. These cases are a nifty idea, like HTC's rather nice Dot View cover, but the LG version is a little more basic and while it does keep the phone protected, I haven't totally fallen in love with them.The Quick Circle caseLG also does other cases, there's a harder shell that replaces the back cover too and aims to protect the phone from drops and scrapes.

It won me over based purely on spec, because it's an LCD - which I prefer to OLED - and it has an impressive resolution of 1440x2560. In practice the screen really is amazing. There's a clarity to it that really startling, and it goes well beyond the spec alone. It does make using the phone a really great experience, and it also makes it hard to go back to phones with lower resolutions. I've found browsing the web to especially benefit from the high resolution, and the phone is powerful enough to make scaling content slick and responsive too.Battery life is good, but having the wireless charger means you can keep the phone charged all the... [+]timeBattery life is another issue, and something I've battled with over the time I've had this phone. To be totally fair to LG, I think it has done a good job. The battery has to run a powerful processor, large screen with massive resolution and that's very challenging. With my heavy use, I can't usually get a full day on a single charge. LG also sent me the wireless charger too, and this makes a lot of sense for modern smartphones. Simply put it on your desk, and stand the phone at it while you work. That way, it's charged when you need it.Going out and about can be a problem of course, but even with heavy use I didn't have massive problems, the phone would be in need of charging early evening, but it would still get me through the day. I got into the habit of carrying an external battery a while ago too, so if it does need a top-up, I can provide one while I'm out.LG G3 menusSome features that I really like about the G3 aren't really that glamourous. But the included keyboard is excellent. I love the prediction, I find it amongst the most accurate I've used on a phone. Some tweaking of the settings will let you turn one the ""path input"" which is the Swype-style draw through letters option. You can also tweak the strength of the auto-correct too, which will be useful if you find it too aggressive. There are also options to update typing corrections from an online database. I've certainly felt no need to follow my own advice andreplace LG's keyboardwith a third-party one.I'm also a massive fan of LGHealth. It's much simpler than other phones options, but it happily tracks how far you walk each day and does so without any extra hardware. This is then presented in a graphically attractive way, and allows you to monitor how far you've walked on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. You can add in other activity too, but I like the simplicity of it.LG Health is a nice little app, and simple to useI like the idea of the split screen feature too. Press and hold the back button, and you can have selected apps running together on one screen. Say, a browser, and messaging. I haven't really found myself using it, but for chatting with friends while looking up directions online, it's a nice idea.The camera is also top-notch. A lot of fuss was made about the laser autofocus. I've found that to be as much of a mixed bag as with any phone's autofocus, but I think it's an improvement over other handsets. Samsung's cameras are pretty quick too though, so there's not as much in this as you might think. I really like the photos and video the G3 produces though, it's deeply impressive with images that have loads of colour and detail.The camera is impressive, although the laser autofocus isn't as amazing as one might hopeLG has made one slight error in the way it is selling the G3. There are basically two versions of the phone, which on the surface appear to be the usual storage options. You pick either 16 or 32GB, but there is a slightly more important difference, that of RAM. In the 16GB model you get 2GB of RAM, and in the 32GB there is 3GB. This is frustrating, as the microSD slot makes opting for the 32GB version less relevant, but the extra 1GB of RAM will make a huge performance difference. It's an odd decision, and I don't like it at all.I've also noticed that the G3 is very sensitive to headphone connection glitches. If you've used Android, you'll know this happens on some phones where moving the cable on the headphone can cause the phone to pause your music. This is annoying, and I've yet to find a solution to it. Also, I can't make the G3 work with a line-out cable in my car, which is the first time I've found that problem.The high-resolution screen is really impressiveIn my opinion, the G3 is the best Android phone in the world right now. It rivalsApple'siPhone for the best overall phone too, and the decision of which to get between Apple's flagship and the G3 will likely come down to which company you'd rather spend money with, or which operating system you're most comfortable with.For me, the LG G3 is perfect, although some might find that they miss features that Samsung has, like the fingerprint scanner and dedicated heart rate monitor. I also predict that Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 will give a run for its money in a few months time, but for me, the G3 is a better phone than anything currently on the market. Of course, it was introduced after everything else, so it's natural it has that as an advantage. It's reasonable to predict that Apple's iPhone 6 and Samsung's upcoming handsets will snap at its heels.  For now though, it's king of the hill.If you haveany questionsabout the G3, or my review, please add a comment below and I'll do my very best to answer. Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to Linkedin Share to Facebook Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Share to Linkedin I've had the LG G3 for a month now and I want to point this out because most reviews - including many of the ones I write - are penned after significantly less time using a handset. I've waited this long, because I wanted to live with the G3 to decide if its many features live up to the hype. Since the G3 was first announced, I've been through a couple of different emotions over the styling. First of all, when I initially saw photos of it, I thought it looked great. Atthe launch event, when I got to use it for the first time, I was less sold. Early rumours had suggested that it would be a metal device, but in fact it's plastic. It felt, to me, a bit less well-built than the iPhone andHTCOne M8. Having actually used it for the past month, I have to say I really like the build quality.   LG G3 from the rear  LG G3 from the rear LG G3 from the rear LG G3 from the rear  For me, plastic is something of an advantage, because it's a bit lighter. That doesn't matter for the iPhone because it's a smaller phone, but when you're looking at devices like the HTC One, it's big enough for that extra weight to make a difference. The G3 is larger than the One, and still lighter, so the body makes sense. Also, metal is a very expensive material to build phones from and doesn't make sense for a lot of manufacturers.  One of the things that caused a ripple of excitement when the phone was announced were the Quick Circle cases. These are covers that protect the back of the phone with a hard cover, and the front with a softer material that has a circle cut into it. This allows the phone to display a clock and basic notifications. These cases are a nifty idea, like HTC's rather nice Dot View cover, but the LG version is a little more basic and while it does keep the phone protected, I haven't totally fallen in love with them.  The Quick Circle case  The Quick Circle case The Quick Circle case The Quick Circle case  LG also does other cases, there's a harder shell that replaces the back cover too and aims to protect the phone from drops and scrapes. Because the phone supports QI wireless charging, you need to make sure that the case supports that if you're planning to use it.

The Korean manufacturer was one of the first companies to feature aflagshipphone, introduce a unique rear-button layout, and experiment in modularity with theLG G5. However, those days are now over. LG hasshut down its smartphone divisionat the end of July 2021. That means we won’t see any more new LG phones.However, there are still some solid recent handsets that are still available for sale, either unlocked or via carriers. While some of these phones may not get much in the way of future software updates, LG has claimed that it will provide atleast two software updatesfor its recent premium phones and some of its lower-priced devices. Keep in mind that LG’s plans could change so you are buying any of its phones on this list at your own risk in terms of software updates.With that said, here is our roundup of some of the best LG phones you can currently buy in 2021! Just keep in mind some may not be available brand new anymore since they are older models.The best LG phones of 2022:LG V60LG VelvetLG WingLG K92LG K71 Stylus1. LG V60Best flagship LG phoneTheLG V60 ThinQis still the latest true flagship offering from the Korean manufacturer. This phone is both powerful and one of the best-looking devices currently on the market. It’s not the newest, but is still the best LG phone you can currently buy.The LG V60 is a5G phonewith all of the specs you’d expect from a flagship. Under the hood, it offers 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and theSnapdragon 865. A massive 5,000mAh battery powers everything. But the LG flagship has a number of advantages over other high-end phones. Like many other LG phones before it, the V60 is an audiophile’s device with a Quad DAC. It has kept both theheadphone jackand the microSD slot—two things that seem to be disappearing from many Android phones as of late. Despite this, it is stillIP68water and dust resistant.Two other great perks the LG V60 offers arewireless chargingand adual-screen accessoryfor multitasking. Although the second screen costs extra, it makes the V60 one of the most versatile devices you can buy—without the worries you might have with afoldable.The 5G flagship also has improved cameras. On the back, you will find a main 64MP camera, accompanied by 13MP ultra-wide and ToF sensors. Unfortunately, the selfie camera is still housed in a notch, but it’s a tiny one that’s relatively easy to ignore. Overall, however, the LG V60 is a truly excellent phone that you shouldn’t overlook.LG V60 ThinQ specs:Display: 6.8-inch, Full HD+SoC: Snapdragon 865RAM: 8GBStorage: 128GBCameras: 64 and 13MP + ToFFront camera: 10MPBattery: 5,000mAhSoftware: Android 102. LG VelvetBest dual-screen LG phoneLG decided to get away from the foldable phone bandwagon. Instead, we got theLG Velvetwith an optional dual screen. More affordable and not prone to display malfunctions, this phone is basically LG’s Velvet in a fancy case.The Velvet is a first for the LG phones lineup as it toes the line between a flagship and a premium mid-range offering. It skips the fastest Snapdragon chip in favor of the765G, but most other specs are first-rate. LG’s Velvet is also one of the most stylish phones we’ve seen in a while thanks to the vibrant finish and unique camera bubbles.See also:The best cases you can get for the LG VelvetThe Velvet is also one tough cookie with itsMIL-STD 810Grating and IP68 certification. It may not look like an adventurer’s device, but you can absolutely take it into the wild. You’ll also have 6GB or 8GB of RAM to work with and 128GB of storage.As for the camera setup, the Velvet comes with three rear sensors. A 48MP wide shooter is flanked by an 8MP ultrawide option and a 5MP depth sensor. Around the front, LG chose a 16MP selfie lens.LG Velvet specs:Display:6.8-inch, Full HD+SoC:Snapdragon 765GRAM:6 or 8GBStorage:128GBCameras:48, 8, and 5MPFront camera:16MPBattery:4,300mAhSoftware:Android 103. LG WingMost unique LG phoneDavid Imel / Android AuthoritySpotify top, maps bottomFolding phones and flip phones have nothing on this handset. The top display of theLG Wingrotates to form a “T” shaped device and gives you a little extra real estate. This is truly the most unique of the LG phones in this list.Although the Wing is an impressive first attempt at an all-new device, we can’t forget that it’s still the first try. It’s not the lightest phone, and the cameras aren’t spectacular, but you’re guaranteed to turn more than a few heads.See also:LG Wing buyer’s guide: Everything you need to knowAs for power, you’re looking at a Snapdragon 765G chip — the same one you’ll find on the Velvet mentioned above. The battery is smaller than the Velvet as well at 4,000mAh. If you love to watch YouTube videos and scroll Twitter at the same time, you’ll probably be well served by the 6.8-inch primary display and the 3.9-inch secondary unit.On the camera front, LG has brought back thepop-up selfie shooterfor its Wing. Because of course there have to be more moving parts. It’s also designed to offer a unique gimbal mode with the three rear-facing cameras, though they’re not powerful enough to compete with a proper gimbal and powerful lens.It can be hard to get your hands on a brand-new version of this phone, but renewed options are available on Amazon.LG Wing specs:Display:6.8-inch QHD+ and 3.9-inch FHDSoC:Snapdragon 765GRAM:8GBStorage:128/256GBCameras:64, 13, and 12MPFront camera:32MPBattery:4,000mAhSoftware:Android 104. LG K92Best mid-range LG phoneLGIf you really want one of the remaining LG phones but want to spend less, look no further than the LG K92. It is the bestmid-rangeLG phone you can currently buy and it’s 5G-ready.The LG K92 sports a big 6.7-inch LCD screen with solid specs under the hood. It offers 6GB of RAM, 128GB of upgradable storage, and it’s powered by a Snapdragon 690G chipset. The K92 comes with Android 10 out of the box. It also has a large 4,000mAh battery, which means you won’t have to reach for the charger often.Like many mid-range devices, the headphone jack andmicroSDslot are still here too. However, the K92 has other great perks. Itsfingerprint scanneris side-mounted, and you get loud stereo speakers, too. Unfortunately, the phone doesn’t have an IP rating, but this is a common occurrence with mid-range and budget devices.The phone won’t fail you in the camera department, however. On the front, you will find a 16MP selfie-sensor. The rear houses a quad AI camera, with a 64MP wide sensor, a 5MP ultra-wide sensor, a 2MP macro, and a 2MP depth sensor. Together, they allow you to take great photos with bokeh effects.LG K92 specs:Display:6.7-inch, FHD+SoC:Snapdragon 690GRAM:6GBStorage:128GBCameras:64, 5, 2, and 2MPFront camera:16MPBattery:4,000mAhSoftware:Android 10LG K71 StylusBest budget LG phoneLGThe LG K71 Stylus is another great choice for one of the mid to budget range LG phones. As you might have guessed from its name, it sports a stylus and it’s a great budget alternative to theGalaxy Note series.You might have expected to see one of LG’s Stylo devices in this section, and that makes perfect sense. In fact, the K71 Stylus is actually a punched-up version of the Stylo 6 so it still fits the bill.The K71 Stylus is the best budget LG phone.In terms of specs, the K71 Stylus is pretty standard. It comes with Android 10 out of the box, and sports 4GB of RAM and 128GB of upgradable storage. It is powered by a MediaTek Helio P35 chipset and a 4,000mAh battery. The stylus is a great addition too, allowing you to navigate apps more easily and create colorful doodles.The cameras, however, are nothing particularly wonderful. You will find a triple-lens setup on the backside, topped off by a 48MP wide shooter. LG paired that with two more 5MP lenses, but the 32MP front-facing camera might be the best of the bunch.LG K71 Stylus specs:Display:6.8-inch, FHD+SoC:MediaTek Helio P35RAM:4GBStorage:128GBCameras:48, 5, and 5MPFront camera:32MPBattery:4,000mAhSoftware:Android 10There you have it — these are our picks for the best LG phones, though again with the company exiting the business, further support is now up in the air.You might likeBest productsLGLG G8Comments    Search results forAll search results Search results for Search results for Search results for  All search results     Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission.Learn more.
